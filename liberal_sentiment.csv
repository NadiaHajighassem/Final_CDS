">President-elect Donald Trump on Monday confirmed he would declare a national emergency to carry out his campaign promise of mass deportations of migrants living in the U.S. without legal permission.

Oh, and before you or anyone else decides to beat me over the head, calling me a quitter or coward, allow me to add one particular incident that took away the choice of staying:  Back in 2017, there were 25 general officers who ALL told trump, face-to-face, that, NO, we would NOT give him our 'oath of personal loyalty'.  I was one of those officers.  All but one of us are retired and all but one are now living in other countries.  He WILL take his revenge out on each and every one of us.  The one remaining officer will soon be 'fired' and most likely arrested, tried, convicted, and possibly executed.

As for the amount of the wager, how about $1 million US, payable in oh, about six months?  It should be worth maybe about 100 Euros by then.

"Seriously doubt it'll go that far. 

I have a hard time believing Trump personally cares at all whether we have millions of undocumented immigrants. 

Deporting millions of people would be a huge undertaking. So there's got to be a constant big return for him in doing it. 

Otherwise, I suspect he'll put on a big show, without actually doing much. And then lie that they deported 10 or 100 times the number of immigrants that they did. Blame a lot of stuff on Democrats, of course. 

Sort of like the wall.

He wasn’t elected in a free and fair election. The Republicans passed more than 100 different laws to limit the ability of Democrats to vote. And I’m not talking about Voter ID. Along with a hundred other things they made it possible for a single person to challenge an unlimited number of voter registrations. Millions of people were kicked off the voter rolls based on ethnicity and _they have openly admitted this_.

Republican election “workers” supposedly tossed mail in ballots for trivial “errors” based on ethnicity and location — ignoring voter intent.

The “True the Vote” organization was behind a lot of this.

The Supreme Court was also in on it and helped them disenfranchise NC voters leading up to the election.

Who really believes he got the popular vote when most people who served with him wouldn’t vote for him? I mean I guess it’s possible but we’ll have to wait and see.

The 2024 election was a farce but he’s the President “Elect” and the race was conceded. I think Harris should have found out how many voters were disenfranchised before conceding but she didn’t.

"""Last spring, Arizona Republicans were in a pickle. The conservative Arizona Supreme Court issued a ruling saying that an obscure 1864 law criminalizing nearly all abortions was valid. This was a position that Republicans in the state had long supported, so long as *Roe* prevented it from being put into practice. But with *Dobbs* the law of the land, the 1864 law was going to be enforced. And it was wildly unpopular.

Republicans controlled the Arizona legislature and so public pressure fell to them to repeal the 160-year-old law. Yet Republicans in the legislature declined to do so.

Arizona already had a ballot initiative scheduled for November. This referendum was sure to pass and when it did, it would invalidate the 1864 law. Republicans did not want to take a vote that would put them at odds with their pro-life base.

But in the six months between then and November, women in Arizona would suffer from the effects of this Draconian law. So Democrats in the legislature and the Democratic governor, Katie Hobs, stepped in. They provided the votes to repeal the law that Republicans had pushed for—thus saving their constituents—but also saving Republicans from the political consequences of their actions.

Democrats fixed the problem the GOP majority had made, instead of letting the unpopular law hang there, like a millstone around the necks of Republican candidates.

**The Fable of the Lankford Bill**

At roughly the same time, President Biden and the Democratic Senate majority approached Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell about negotiating an immigration bill. McConnell tapped the conservative Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford to write a border hawk’s dream, and that’s exactly what he did. The Lankford bill was easily the toughest immigration law in generations—Democrats gave away the store and asked for nothing in return. Republicans got everything they ever said they wanted.

And then, after the Republicans’ designated negotiator declared victory, the rest of the Republican party in Congress balked. They chose to abandon their own bill because instead of solving the problems at the border, they wanted to be able to use immigration as an issue to help Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.

He has been listed as one of the worst presidents in the history of the US.

>*Survey of 154 scholars places 45th president behind even ‘historically calamitous chief executives’ linked to civil war. Donald Trump finished 45th and rock bottom of a list ranking US presidents by greatness, trailing even “historically calamitous chief executives” who failed to stop the civil war or botched its aftermath.*

"The most immediate upside that I can think of to Trump winning is that this will be his last four years. The legacy will continue.

There’s a handful of politicians, not only in Washington, but across the country, that have followed the same script of performance politics that Trump has, and it has worked for them. It makes me wonder if there’s a handful of Democrats out there that could follow that same blueprint, just tuned more towards center interest and left leaning, voters and get elected as well. 

Imagine that shake up.

Also consider this: American voters had no problem, electing a felon into office. On top of that. SCOTUS determined that a president has immunity. Notice how quiet people have been about “the Joe Biden crime family“? 

That means that if it’s going to be OK for a Republican to be a convicted felon and run for office, and have immunity, you would think that would mean the same for a democrat.

The vast majority of what you’re told about Trump is a lie. 

My advice for you all, trip the algorithms and get out of your liberal bubble. 

Trump didn’t win because he’s great (though he did a LOT of things right). He won because the democrats are terrible and everyone is tired of the lying and the identity politics. 

With Trumps win, identity politics are dead. It’s over. If the dems keep pushing something that no one wants, they will continue to lose. 

Go watch the last few podcasts from Triggernometry for a balanced understanding of why they lost. 

It’s REALLY important everyone, and especially the dems actually start to listen and learn why they lost and how to fix it. 

They needed this slap in the face. Thats the silver lining. If they learn nothing, then there is no silver lining and they keep losing.

"I think the Trump 2.0 experience is going to vary by state. Blue states are going to push back against MAGA in a bunch of ways.

Blue states generally grant ICE that ability, but so far a handful of state AGs have vowed not to collaborate with ICE on the Trump mass deportation project. Blue states are also going to tie him up in court. The Supreme Court can only hear so many cases so the strategy here is to bring as many lawsuits as possible over the next four years to make sure none of his extreme policies can be enacted. Also state legislators are codifying rights in their state constitutions. And lastly, I live in California and I get Republicans talk shit about us on a regular basis, but they’re scared of us.

"“Could be a little harder in the winter.”

Maybe we should try lowering our consumption of things not in season?  Americans have become a culture of convenience and not practicality.  That’s why when I hear people talk about the economy I roll my eyes.  It’s not about “what they can afford”, it’s about affording their addiction to overconsumption in every avenue.

Read my post again.  If you don’t think spending more money to get out of season foods, which take more resources than necessary, isn’t a symptom of our nations addiction to overconsumption, and can’t provide any evidence that states *any* benefit to doing so, then you aren’t prepared for this discussion.

"Honestly, the best thing would be to talk less about vulnerable groups among Republicans and swing voters. That's not what they care about, and we need to win elections or the future will look very dark for many members of those groups. Our message this election should have been:

""Donald Trump wants your kids to die of drug overdoses.""

""Donald Trump: For open borders. For himself.""

""Nothing makes Donald Trump happier than putting Americans out of work.""

""Donald Trump: Offshoring jobs, raising prices, and sticking you with the bill.""

Remeber: We can't legislate against hate unless we win elections. Talking about what swing state voters care about is how we win elections, and like it or not, many of them don't give a rat's ass about these social issues, or favor Republicans on these issues. Explaining things won't win over voters, it just makes them feel talked down to and frankly most people are not political junkies and don't have time for this.

Young women, victims of wxual abuse and statutory rape, testified.

>*In a statement Wednesday announcing his pick, Trump said Gaetz would root out “systemic corruption” at the Justice Department and return the department “to its true mission of fighting crime and upholding our democracy and constitution.”*

Numerous Republicans have revealed that the nomination is inappropriate and won't go through.

Mike Simpson of Idaho said he has a hard time believing Gaetz will be able to get through the Senate confirmation process. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she didn’t believe Gaetz was a serious candidate.*

Pete Hegseth, a Fox News Host with nazi symbols on his body, and clearly announced feelings regarding the U.S. Constitution (that is contrary to current U.S. Constitution written text) has been nominated to be the Secretary of Defense.

>*In 2021, Hegseth was one of 12 National Guard members removed from a role guarding President Biden's inauguration after vetting by military officials due to possible extremist ties. He has tattoos associated with white supremacists and neo-Nazis (on a recent podcast, Hegseth defended one as ""just a Christian symbol"").*

No matter how it is explained by sycophants loyal to the negativity of the Republicans and their cult leader?

Numerous searches will provide  references on the internet and social media platforms that refer to the symbols as being attached to negative connotations, including pro-Natzi and anti-Muslim extremist movements. 

>*...it is important to know that symbols and language tied to the Crusades are very present in some extremist movements. You know, this was a symbol on display on January 6. It was contained in the writings of neo-Nazi mass-shooter who killed scores at a summer camp in Norway in 2011. And it could signal a deep antipathy toward Islam.*

He has explained his agenda and what he plans to do.

>*Hegseth is the author of the recent book ""The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free,"" a New York Times bestseller, in which he denounces what he calls the ""warped, woke, and caustic policies of our current military."" In it, he blamed former President Barack Obama and the Pentagon for shortfalls in recruitment, claiming they ""embraced the social justice messages of gender equity, racial diversity, climate stupidity, and the LGBTQA+ alphabet soup in their recruiting pushes."" He continued: ""Only one problem: There just aren't enough lesbians from San Francisco who want to join the 82nd Airborne. Not only do the lesbians not join, but those very same ads turn off the young, patriotic, Christian men who have traditionally filled our ranks.""*

Please🙏 for our military.

Please surround them with the knowledge and capabilities to withstand the pressure of a white supremist who happens to be a Trump loyalist.

Trump and his sycophants have taken the first steps to destroy America.

Trump ordered Congress to take an unplanned recess so that his suggested cabinet appointments can sail through with NO vetting or Congressional inquiry / approval.

>*Trump's plan to use recess appointments, along with the announcement that Republican senators' support bypassing the Senate vetting process, is unusual.This exception to the process means that when the Senate is on recess, the president can make an appointment to a position that normally requires Senate approval. The process was created when Congress didn't meet as often as it does today, and was to be used in emergencies. It is also supposed to be a temporary appointment and expires at the end of a congressional session - at most, one year.*

This method of getting appointments through was used previously, but SCOTUS decided against it in 2014 when President Obama used it to make some appointments. I wonder if it means Trump needs SCOTUS approval to use it again? 

>*Some past presidents have employed the method liberally, often as a way of circumventing political divides that would slow nominations. George W Bush made 171 recess appointments, Bill Clinton made 139 and Barack Obama made at least 32, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS). This method of getting nominees into office was virtually stopped after the Supreme Court ruled against Obama in 2014, striking down multiple recess appointments and calling them unconstitutional.*

The process to vet presidential  nominees is to complete numerous forms and provide testimony via a Senate committee (where commitee members may pose questions). Afterwards, a full vote of the Senate will take place to approve the nomination. 
  
>*The Senate approval process requires nominees to submit financial disclosure forms, fill out a questionnaire - which differs based on the role - and testify before a Senate committee. These hearings can sometimes be contentious. They allow members from both political parties to question nominees about their backgrounds and plans for the post. After the hearing, the committee votes on the nomination. If it approves the candidate, the full Senate then votes on the nominee.*

A simple Senate majority is needed to ensure the nominee is approved.

>*A simple majority of senators present at the time of the vote is necessary to approve the nominee, according to the center.*

Leave everything for me - I'll be back in a few hours after you're all gone. I'm sorry, but I can't be here.

I agree completely that this is not a political disagreement. These are fundamental differences about right & wrong. And about democracy vs plutocracy.

"If that were true, then marginalized groups, including women, wouldn't feel marginalized (or persecuted) by the right. Let's consider abortion, religion, or LGBTQ issues/topics. I'm a straight white heterosexual Anglo-Saxon protestant, so I'm coming from an old-institution perspective. LGBTQ folks want equal rights. That's all. I don't feel like anyone's forcing me to be gay. They just want to live their lives as straight people do. ""Yeah, but what about parades and pride month? There's no such thing as straight month or straight parades."" These things exist so that people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc. don't have to hide who they are. No one ever agonizes over coming out as straight to their parents. 

The same thing goes for abortions. When my wife was pregnant, no one tried forcing her to have an abortion. My son is now a healthy 12-year-old. The argument goes abortion is killing a baby. And the left is fine with killing babies. These aren't babies. Babies have names and social security numbers. And no one wants abortions. Contrary to the belief on the right, liberals don't use abortion as a form of birth control. Since Dobbs, women's lives have been put in danger and some have even died because they were denied healthcare and a fetus was involved. When he was president, Clinton once said that abortion should be "" safe, legal, and rare"". I'm pretty sure that adage still applies to abortion advocates today. 

And then religion. There is such a thing as a separation of church and state, but don't tell that to the politicians in Oklahoma. They want the Christian Bible taught in every school. What's the problem? The kids in Oklahoma aren't getting enough theology in Sunday school, church, and youth group? This whole war on Christianity and war on Christmas thing makes my eyes roll. Are we going to create a law that forbids people from saying happy holidays? I'm a Christian, and I never feel like my ability to go to church on Sunday is ever threatened. Speaking of theology, most of the conservative Christians in my extended family don't even go to church. And the ones that do have only a Sunday school knowledge of the Bible. Besides all the religious education I got as a teenager, I also took three theology classes in college. Jewish scholars will tell you that most of these things my family bases their opinions on in the Torah were either fairy tales intended to teach a lesson (Adam, Noah, Lot) or involved stories of real people that were embellished. Moses and Solomon existed, and many of the things that they did happened according to scholars, but some of the things were embellished, like George Washington chopping down a cherry tree and Davy Crockett shooting a bear when he was three. I'm a monotheist because I believe there is a God, and I am a Christian because, to quote Winston Zeddamore from Ghostbusters, I really dig Jesus' style. But not everyone in this country is a Christian, and even those with a cursory knowledge of the Bible can tell you that forced faith isn't faith at all. People have to have their own literal come to Jesus moment. Forcing public schools to teach Christianity is not going to convert anyone. 

The point I'm trying to make is that people on the left just want to live their lives as well, but they want to be treated as equals, and they're not. The right considers them second class citizens.

People like you are the most dangerous gun owners.  You might think you are buying and learning firearms for the right reason…..  but you come off as buying a weapon solely to create violence, not to defend yourself, or for the sport of shooting, marksmanship or hunting, or collecting.    

You have made several comments in this thread about punching people and being violent.   

It’s one thing to arm yourself for self defense.  It’s a whole different category when you are buying a gun with the intention of planning to use it to harm another person who has not threatened you directly, and who you simply have opposite political leanings with.  

You clearly did not grow up around them, or the culture of gun ownership and respect.   So if you find a teacher, who will probably be very Republican-  you better pay attention to what they try to teach you.  You will also notice they have nothing but respect for you trying to learn and exercise your right to own a firearm.  

Exercise your right, go the range.  Learn your weapon and become extremely proficient with it.  But get your head right as to when and where to brandish it.

"I have a fair amount of experience in government, and I have a small amount of hope in the bureaucracy. A lot of federal functions are actually done by states through grants. I'll use an example based upon an area that I have some familiarity with. Let's say Trump ordered the EPA to stop monitoring mercury levels in fish. EPA doesn't actually do this work; the actual work is getting done by state employees or state contractors or local county or city employees or contractors who are implementing an approved action plan funded by a a combination of state matching funds and federal grant funds. The grant contract end date might be 2029 (many federal grants are 5 years long) and the regulation that implements the federal authorizing legislation that formed the local/state/federal partnership may date back to the 1970's. The programs are overseen by professionals on both the federal and non-federal side who have graduate degrees in this area and who likely have decades of experience in the area. 

The people implementing most federal programs are union employees and the closest political appointee is 3 or 4 levels of bureaucracy higher. Ending funding that is granted out to states would have to go through a tedious process to sever 50 individual grants with states or local governments. It might get caught up in the courts. The states may decide to keep doing the work with local funds (because the grant amount doesn't cover the full cost anyhow).  Governors on both sides of the aisle would lobby the federal government to continue the funding. 17% of state government revenues on average come from federal grants so there are a LOT of federal functions that work this way (https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2024/04/how-much-funding-do-state-and-local-governments-receive-from-the-federal-government). While it may seem like the president could tell the EPA to stop doing this work, it is way more complicated than that. 

Of course, this doesn't apply to everything, but compare the number of state and local employees in your state (https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/federal-employment-reports/reports-publications/federal-civilian-employment/) to the number of state and local government employees (https://www.governing.com/archive/states-most-government-workers-public-employees-by-job-type.html) and you get the picture that there really aren't that many federal workers in most states so anything that requires on-the-ground work is likely being done by states or local governments.",2024-11-14 17:03:54,neutral,0.5999,0.3299,0.5999,0.0703,r/conservative

I don’t know on the exact number, but I can honestly say that I know of maybe two liberal/progressive talkshow hosts that are on traditional over the air radio and there has to be at least 4 to 5 times that number for conservative talkers. 

TV is probably about the same though. MSNBC is definitely leaning left. Meanwhile, you have Fox News, FOXBusiness channel, Newsmax and OAN. Yeah, conservatives will swear up and down. CNN is being liberal, but I hear just as many liberals complain about CNN trying to pander to conservatives so I think that’s debatable.

Here are several examples that illustrate how the U.S. military has been described as adopting ""woke"" policies or practices:


Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Programs: The Department of Defense (DoD) has implemented various DEI initiatives. Critics argue that these programs, aimed at promoting inclusivity and addressing disparities within the ranks, distract from the military's primary mission of readiness and combat effectiveness. Some see these efforts as prioritizing social issues over warfighting capabilities.
LGBTQ+ Pride Events: The military has hosted events like the annual LGBTQ+ Pride Ceremony at the Pentagon, showcasing its commitment to inclusion. While supporters view this as an effort to celebrate diversity and support all service members, critics might label such events as ""woke"" for focusing on identity politics.
Gender Transition Policies: Policies allowing for gender transition, including non-deployability for periods during transition, have been cited as examples of the military bending to social ideology. Critics argue this reflects a shift towards accommodating social agendas rather than focusing solely on military readiness.
Reading Lists and Educational Materials: The inclusion of books like ""How to Be Antiracist"" by Ibram X. Kendi in professional reading programs has been criticized by some as promoting critical race theory and other ideologies they deem as ""woke.""
Recruitment and Representation: Efforts to increase diversity in specific roles, like aviation or leadership positions, have been pointed out by critics as prioritizing demographic balance over merit. For instance, there have been public statements from high-ranking officials about goals to increase the representation of African Americans in leadership and aviation roles.
Social Media and Speech Policies: There have been concerns raised about potential monitoring of service members' social media to ensure alignment with certain ideological views, which could be seen as enforcing a particular narrative or set of beliefs.
Cultural Training and Stand-downs: After events like the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, the military conducted stand-downs to address extremism within the ranks. While intended to maintain discipline and unity, some perceive these as attempts to impose political correctness or align with certain political ideologies.


These examples reflect criticisms often voiced by those who argue that the military's focus has shifted from traditional military values to what they describe as ""woke"" policies. However, supporters of these initiatives believe they strengthen the military by ensuring it reflects and serves a diverse nation, thereby enhancing cohesion and effectiveness.",2024-11-14 06:22:32,neutral,0.6029,0.3286,0.6029,0.0685,r/conservative

"If you want to point out the flaws of the left when it comes to politically organizing, I’ll not argue with you there. We have a huge issue with infighting. And if you pay any attention to Alan Lichtman, it’s potentially a cause as to why we lost. We excoriated our sitting incumbent president after he’d won the primary in an election year. 

The problem is, we actually think as individuals. We have people who think more deeply and broadly than most conservatives ever will. And because of that we have a lot of headstrong people that come to their own distinct conclusions. We are not a party that will ever think alike on the level of the conservatives…and I’m honestly happy about that. But we suffer because of it. We don’t rally around candidates. We eat our own. Liberals in particular seem to want to be inspired by leadership. And worst of all, we actually still have shame and integrity. 

FWIW, I don’t think apathy is a viable answer. I know my “this is frustrating” and “I’m tired” position isn’t helpful. I’m just morose, grieving, and lost in this moment, and don’t really have it in me to be optimistic, to be hopeful, to keep fighting RIGHT NOW. That’s almost certain to change.

And I say this as someone who is an Oklahoma voter who votes blue, Satan has a better chance of winning as a Republican here than Jesus does as a Democrat. So for some, especially if they were not energized to vote, they may see it as a pointless endeavor.

As for myself, I didn’t vote for Biden in the primary. I really didn’t like the coronation of Kamala, and as a non swing state voter I really did consider just leaving that section of the ballot blank. A lot of it for me was that this is the third election in a row I was asked to hold my nose and vote for a candidate that I didn’t like. But, I’m one of the voters mobilized by democracy and I couldn’t sleep well knowing that I hadn’t done whatever I personally could if our democracy does fall. 

That being said, I can only speak for what I had to decide on, and the battles in my own heart. For those that are completely blind or deaf to the threat to democracy I really can understand the logic they made in their head to not vote.

# Violence is ‘likely’ after the election, 80% of N.J. voters say in alarming new poll

published Nov 1

>New Jersey voters are carrying fear and anxiety to the polls as they cast their ballots for president in an election in which both parties say democracy is at stake.  
Those voters are worried about the state of the nation. About the future  
And about political violence erupting after Election Day.  
That’s according to new polling by Rutgers-Eagleton, in partnership with NJ Advance Media, that examined extremism in New Jersey, a deep blue state that has seen a growing partisan divide and [a rise in far-right politics](https://archive.ph/o/neaNJ/https://projects.nj.com/extreme/).

You mentioned:

>>*Yes, I do recall them. Do you recall when the AG and President Biden *started* the process? My point is, knowing Trump's general proclivities, they should have started DAY 1 of the Biden administration on this.*

They have to investigate, hire appropriate personnel, go through research, interview people, subpoena people, put up with people ignoring subpoenas, establish the grand jury, present to the grand jury, put up with Trump's numerous delay tactics through various courts (some of which took a really long time via presenting a case, getting a decision, his appealing the decision, getting a decision and appealing as high as he could, etc.).

All of those delay tactics aren't resolved in months. We are talking loooooong delays.  

He used to lament - where's my Roy Cohn. He taught Trump every single pathway he took to avoid prosecution.

Up to and including attacking the cases and personnel with personal attacks and denials.

Even though the evidence is cleatly there.

For all to see.

Except for his sycophants and cult members, who have decided to protect and stand by the side of a Fascist Want-to-Be Dictator, Insurrectionist, and Twice Impeached 34x Convicted Felon and Convicted Sexual Abuser (with additional charges pending) Republican Cult Leader and now Presidential Elect Trump.

Who has been told by SCOTUS that he is basically protected.

I'm very concerned about every single thing he wants to do.

If people actually researched what he said he would do?

They would find out what the truth is instead of believing the alternative facts (lies) that they seem to be getting from news sources that are not telling the truth.

>*An aspiring fascist is the president-elect, again, of the United States. This is our political reality: Donald Trump is going to bring a claque of opportunists and kooks (led by the vice president–elect, a person who once compared Trump to Hitler) into government this winter, and even if senescence overtakes the president-elect, Trump’s minions will continue his assault on democracy, the rule of law, and the Constitution.*

I'm sure most people have seen / heard the Fascist Want-to-Be Dictator, Insurrectionist, and Twice Impeached 34x Convicted Felon and Convicted Sexual Abuser (with additional charges pending) Republican Cult Leader and now Presidential Elect Trump's rallies or speeches?

I do not look forward to all of the awful and disgusting changes he plans on implementing.

It seems America forgot his disastrous first presidency.

He has been listed as one of the worst presidents in the history of the US.

>*Survey of 154 scholars places 45th president behind even ‘historically calamitous chief executives’ linked to civil war. Donald Trump finished 45th and rock bottom of a list ranking US presidents by greatness, trailing even “historically calamitous chief executives” who failed to stop the civil war or botched its aftermath.*

"Tbh Trump is just a symptom of a bigger underlying problem, including rampant misinformation and right wing propaganda via Twitter and Russian bot farms. 

I can't believe I'm even saying this but these actual facts make me feel like a conspiracy theorist, and I've always be a realist who tries to use logic and reason to arrive at a conclusion, context and nuance are important, but so is not ignoring evidence of corruption as well. 

Every accusation is a confession. The Republicans have been telling us exactly what they're doing. They have been carefully gaslighting us and consistently chipping away at our beliefs and confidence, post 2020 election was all a long con to get the public used to election fraud, and to normalize having little faith in our democracy. It was never about actually trying to steal the election, it was about sowing division and Infighting to destabilize us. 

Now that doubting the election results is normalized, they were able to hedge their bets if for some reason Trump didn't win, everything was prepped to assault the results and instead of a their experiments and learning from various strategies in 2020, they would have a much higher chance to succeed this time. 

Maybe it was a well designed long con, that needed time to mold the opinions of the people, and ofc to implement voter suppression, intimidation, purging rolls within 3 months, exploiting laws and changing precedents via the alt right supermajority SCOTUS. 

Also 4 years to carefully plan and implement manipulated firmware/software on voting machines 9 months ahead of time in swing states and tight race counties. We know Musk and starlink were involved in swing state voting machines. I think it would be foolish to not investigate and verify swing states,for our peace of mind and to restore faith in our democracy. 

They claimed voter fraud and election interference and then crickets when he won. Now they will forget about it and frame us unamerican and unpatriotic, traitors and sore loser snowflakes for questioning key areas that flipped Trump this time around. 


Getting a tech billionaire on board who would buy and use a social media site for his own narcissistic reasons to push alt right propaganda to everyone,and NOT ALLOW USERS TO BAN HIS PERSONAL ACCOUNT, or other alt right accounts.  I literally have banned Leon Peon Muskrat at least 7 times in 2-3 months. Insanity. This was mutually beneficial for MAGA and Putin. 

It's entirely possible his whole trying to back out of the hostile takeover was scripted, to give him deniability that he wasn't actually buying Twitter for election interference and to silence any non right wing views or actual facts checking.

More than likely he got himself into a financial and legal pickle trying to back out and then not having enough liquidity to finish the deal. I believe this is likely when he became somewhat compromised by a foreign dictator and/or government, who gave him a loan or even a donation to complete the twitter deal and use it for malicious reasons. He may also have blackmail on musk,it's entirely possible. Same with DonOLD . 



It was also Muskrats lifelong weird obsession with the letter X and the domain X.com. numerous times he tried to make x com relevant and cool, but failed with PayPal etc,. 

Let's not forget how much wealth Vladimir Putin actually has still, and how that can be used for a full scale Information war, cyberware hacking, propaganda etc. also bribes and blackmail to consolidate his power even more. 

I hate what the past 8 years has done to myself and our beloved democracy, it's turned me into a borderline conspiracy theorist, but there is just way too much suspicious events and situations, and some of these dots being connected isn't really much of a stretch, means and motive are clear. It's not some pizzagate whackos stuff. 

Look, we need some hard evidence and I'm really trying to not let myself get tunnel vision and stay grounded.

"People make decisions based on emotion,and then retcon reasons to justify the decision. There is a reason why Marketing: is a thing.

Look at the economy. It is stronger now than it has been in hte last 60 years, but nobody is telling voters that. Are some people struggling? Certainly, but there have always been people struggling.

Inflation was at 4% when Reagan left office--double what it is now--and he is remembered as a great economic president.  Reagan averaged 7% unemployment, roughly double what it is now. Under Biden, wage growth outpaced inflation, under Reagan, wages actually *fell.* From 1980 to 1983, those living in poverty increased from 13% to 15.2%. From 1984 to 1987, the homeless population doubled. The federal debt went fromm $738 billion to $2.1 trillion during Reagan's time in office. In 1984, the interest rate on a 30-year mortgage was 13.87%, double what it is now.

Reagan claimed it was morning in America in 1984, that the economy was booming, and won in a landslide. How was he able to do this? *The media helped him.* The media told people things were great, and people believed it. It *felt* like things were great, so things *were* great.

Today, even though the economy is roaring and everyone has a job, the media searched out some rube is Gobbler's Knob who laments egg prices (which the government has very little if anything to do with) and OH MY GOD THE ECONOMY IS A HELLSCAPE. Nobody bothered to explain how global supply chains, and avian flu impact the nations poultry production. 

People focus on eggs going up, but ignore the fact that you can get a 75"" TV for less than $400. 

This is why MAGA demonizes migrants and men with moustaches and lipstick. It's to get people to ignore how good things actually are, and focus on the horror that is individual expression--another thing people claim to like but are terrified of and actually hate.

No amount of explaining reality, or changing the message, or anything else will combat this. No matter how Democrats message, it is the Hate Machine that names things, describes things, and controls things. 

Already, polls show that people think the economy is improving even though things are the same as they were a week ago. It's because Trump won, and he is good on economic issues (LOL), so everything is better. This is simply because the media isn't focused on telling people how bad things are anymore.

"Totally agree with the concrete solutions that benefit the middle class, not only that but the messaging on these issues need to be addressed. 

If Trump carries through mass deportation, the nation is going to see just how much the economy depends on immigrants. 25-40% of workers in meat processing, dairy, harvesting fruit are immigrants and a very large fraction are illegal. When the cost of beef, eggs, and milk doubles over a 3-6 month period and we experience shortages like a third world country, people might realize how dumb they are. There are no Americans that want those jobs for minimum wage and no benefits. Not only that, but if processing meat is disrupted because 80% of the people working on the processing line are deported, the truckers that transport meat to and from, the accountants, supervisors, inspectors, etc. are going to be sitting at home without work to do. Nothing like sky rocketing inflation at the same time as increases unemployment to change people minds. It is really hard to F--- the economy any worse than what Trump is proposing.  

45-60 percent of roofers, masons, framers are immigrants. What happens to the electrician, plumber, steel worker jobs when construction grinds to a halt because there are not enough workers to fill those jobs.  If those immigrants are replaced with legal citizens at higher prices, this will increase the cost of construction, which will result in companies not doing new builds. Putting more people out of work. Oh and lack of new housing is going to further increase housing prices. I could go on for pages, but I believe this could put an end to the MAGA cult and will allow for common sense immigration reform. 

\* On inflation, there is nothing the President can to to bring down inflation caused by simultaneous supply side issues and a super-heated economy.  Other than sympathize with voters and say we are doing everything we can do to address the issue, which was done. How do you message on the issue? Without straight up making up non-sense like Trump. 

\* Disagree on taxes. The primary reason the middle class and poor are declining economically is because almost all the increased wealth generated over the last 30 years has went to the top 1%. And a huge fraction of it is concentrated in the hands of a couple 1000 people. the top 400 wealthiest Americans have over 4.5 trillion dollars in wealth, it is probably closer to 5 trillion now. That is almost enough wealth to fund the entire federal government for 2 years. It is enough wealth that they could cut a check for $50,000 to 100 million American families.  There are no ways to address this that don't include increasing taxes on the wealthy, specifically capital gains and decreasing taxes on the middle class, ideally in a way that increases wealth. The middle class and poor fell for the classic shell game (blame poor immigrants, not the wealthy who are flexing their power to increase their wealth at our expense). The messaging has to improve. Kamala's plan blew up in her face due to poor messaging, the specifics were there. It needed to be tweaked, and the messaging and specifics at to how the money collected is going to increase the wealth of the middle class needs to improve.

"Some good points in here. You are almost certainly correct that developers are making more money employing illegal immigrants. Certainly developers are not going to price the new home they produce less than market prices. Aside from production costs, supply and demand figure heavily into real-estate prices. Lets say you have an area that many people are moving into and demand is very high. If developers (because of a shortage of labor) build 60 instead of 100 homes in a year. That is going to drive up the price of homes in the area (not just for the new homes) because demand far exceeds supply, making housing more expensive (irrespective of labor costs). I am for American workers earning more and being employed. However, unemployment is at 4.1 percent. There are not that many people out of work at the moment, though certainly it is higher in some states /locations. Take a few minutes and google natural rate of unemployment, and what happens if the unemployment rate dips lower. 

Honestly, we should allow for X amount of legal immigrants to work based of metrics (unemployment, need for low cost labor, predicted economic growth, etc.). My guess, i don't know this for sure (I am not an economist), is that the number of illegal immigrants we have in the country is close to what our country needs (in terms of workers) to sustain growth.

The cost of that write off being paid by the taxes collected on the purchase of new homes, and the new workers wages. The developer being taxed at the end of the year is when profits are realized, if at all. Some developers do well, some go under. That's just the game.

That's all why I wanna bring up the unemployment rate, and just how misdirected it can be. You could have an unemployment rate of 4% but also simultaneously a large shadow economy of cash paid workers. Leaving citizen workers left to work the various low pay temp/gig jobs in the market. Their technically reporting as employed, but are extremely low wage citizens. This is because the premium for other work they'd have access to is artificial pushed down by the cash paid illegals who have no choice but to accept at most times, below federal minimum wage.

Ofcouse this shadow economy also determines where an immigrant goes, in the hopes of getting the most money as possible; sanctuary cities. It's here where the working class citizens i mention earlier have the most loss in opportunities. This eventually affects adjacent high skilled labor markets as the supply of people breaking in increases and even surpasses localized demand.

This pushes the pay for things like welders, plumbers, landscapers, truck drivers, and even gig workers down. This has a virual effect of high tier occupations aswell, as on any level, you have people trying to break into high earning occupations. 

The increased supply of lawyers, tech workers, and even medical professionals increases beyond demand, thus pushing down even their wages down to below inflation adjustments.

Who benefits? The same prople who've always benefited. The investors, but you call them ""the rich"". They are the ones behind it. Through a steady, complex lobbying operation, they installed the right leaders that would screw up in just the right way; leaving the border completely open.

I mean have you ever wondered why it's so hard to find a job, yet the unemployment rate is so low? That's the cause. The employment spectrum has been massive stretched out, along with the relative wages, by the shadow economy.",2024-11-12 00:27:31,neutral,0.4602,0.4485,0.4602,0.0913,r/conservative

"I call B.S. on this argument.  No amount of tax incentives will allow developers to build houses  when the workers required to make the houses are not available. Tax incentives, not always bad, in this context equals gifting developers money, to do what they should be doing without incentives. There needs to be more competition in the industry, I need to read and think about why there is not more. More money transferred from  tax payers to corporate profits is not the way. 

Your argument about the shadow economy, nicely worded, might convince some, but it is a logical fallacy and full of half truths. 1st, the shadow economy exists, but is not as large as it is made out to be and the effects are largely exaggerated on wages. A big fraction of the shadow economy that is labor,  is done by illegal immigrants. The shadow economy fills jobs needed for the economy.  We agree up to this point. The problem is you are wrong  about the availability of American citizens to do jobs once the immigrants are deported and the shadow economy moves into the light. Millions of people left the job market during Covid and are not coming back, they sure in the F### are not going to come back to pick fruit in rural Idaho, roof houses, or process meat. You could double wages on those industries and still not fill all the jobs. The idea that there are millions of  Americans that will take these jobs is a farce. Nationwide there is currently a shortage of workers to fill positions in low wage industries. Practically every restaurant and store has unfilled positions where I live, to the point they are cutting hours and reducing services.  If young people were available to take those jobs there would not be a flood of unfillabIe  job vacancies. I can cite dozens of non-partisan sources to back up the fact there is currently a labor shortage, particularly for low paying jobs. Hence, your argument that people exist to fill jobs created by deportations is a poor one. I have a pretty big and diverse network. Although anecdotal, no one I know has any problem  finding a job. 

Also, you are wrong about people working in the shadow economy being counted as employed, when it comes to unemployment statistics. Illegal immigrants don't count either way, but American citizens working in the shadows #edit for clarity -do not count as employed#, which means true unemployment levels are very slightly lower than reported. Normally good, but when you are proposing to shed 3 million or more workers from the economy, it makes a policy of deportation dumb as a bag of rocks.

Consequently, you are right that we should move people out of the shadow economy.  The way to do this is to increase the number of immigrants allowed to work legally in the country.  So that they can get higher wages and benefits. So that they can pay income tax. They do pay sales and other taxes already. By your own argument, this would result in higher wages for American citizens in lower tier jobs and wage inflation for people in mid tier jobs. 

Ultimately, history will prove one of us right. Likely me.",2024-11-12 06:49:07,negative,0.6167,0.6167,0.3355,0.0479,r/conservative

"Reaganomics has decimated the middle class. Worse yet, it has created an ""underclass"" of millions of people. And pretty much no economic legislation for the past 20 years has had any effect at all on the underclass.  They still have extremely limited access to jobs, housing, and basic needs.

Turns out those folks have decided that since politics has no effect on them, they won't bother to vote.

So that's a suggestion your question could follow. How can we have an effect such that the underclass will vote for our candidates?",2024-11-10 20:39:43,negative,0.8337,0.8337,0.1514,0.0149,r/conservative

And thats stretching and eating the cheapest bare minimum for our one meal a day with the stamps. I try to always at least provide supper everyday in my home no matter what. Key word is try. 


And yes, I know it is only a program that helps supplement families with food. I'm not complaining. Believe me, we are very grateful for any help at this point. 

Because I know we should be grateful to even have a home to pay bills in right now. Many have it even worse than us. And that makes me feel horrible for well for even just explaining myself, I guess. 

P.S. I'm 42 and never struggled to this extent in my entire adult life just to pay bills and eat. The bare fkn minimum. But my husband's health is failing and he is chronically ill now, so I am trying my best... 

And yes I voted for Harris. I had hoped, at the very least, prices wouldn't increase more than they already are. And that she would help fix the healthcare situation that so many are already in.

 Because ten states already didn't expand Medicaid. And yes people with disabilities are doing without insurance because of it or at least until they can get their disability approved. 
And did I mention FML because yeah FML 😆

"This isn't just my opinion- Read this article that just came out today by The Hill:

Vice President Kamala Harris’s resounding defeat at the hands of former President Donald Trump is not only a rejection of the Democratic Party and what it stands for, but also of the mainstream media, and the narrative they created for Harris. 

Why is that? Quite simply, because both Harris and Democrats fundamentally mistook the mood of the electorate. The mainstream media went along with the illusion that Harris and the Democrats operated under, despite substantial evidence to the contrary. 


Specifically, Democrats came to believe that by turning over the campaign to Harris’ “new way forward” and “politics of joy,” without a primary process or any serious discussion of the issues, they could somehow circumvent two key facts about the electorate. The first was that President Biden’s approval rating (36 percent per CNN) rivaled that of former President Jimmy Carter on the eve of his overwhelming 1980 loss to Ronald Reagan (37 percent per Gallup polling). 

Second, the share of voters believing the country is headed in the “right direction” was nearly identical between that 1980 election and the 2024 election, and not in Democrats’ favor. Less than one-fifth (17 percent) of Americans felt that way in a pre-election Ipsos poll, and a similar 20 percent said the same ahead of the 1980 election, according to the Roper Center. 

Taken together, the fact that the American people wanted a new direction, new policies, and new leadership, doomed Democrats in 1980 as it doomed Kamala Harris this week.

Instead, we need to focus on how do we slow the radicalization of young adults. Based on the voting shift we saw. In particular among young men, who are historically most susceptible to radicalization.

We need to look at the people who really don't trust either side, yet voted for Trump, because they came to the conclusion that Trump would be better for the economy. It's the Republican lie of they are better for business which has been perpetuated for decades. 

How do we break through that fiction Republicans have created about the economy? How do we get people to see the both sides are not the same?

Even most of my coworkers weren't as onboard with the right this time around.

I've seen things here on reddit that make me feel like there is a possibility that votes could be changed if the tabulation programs were altered months ago in an if/then command for Nov 5 specifically. That the same machine could give completely accurate results every time it was tested, until the time when it actually counted. And back to accurate afterward.

Maybe that's what people on the right were saying 4 years ago...

It's really hard to not sound like a hypocrite when everyone on the left preemptively declared that the system was secure.

What was proposed in that thread was to look at precincts where the results were way off of what was expected, especially in heavily red areas. It would be easier to make a red precinct more red than to turn a blue one red. Then do a handful of handcount comparisons to the tabulated results to see if they match.

It would also mean talking with them about fascist rhetoric. The techniques it uses to to create the cult like following Trump has. And specifically the rhetorical appeals that it uses on young people to radicalize them. 

So I'll emphasize again that this is a psyops war we're in. The political arena, where our leaders operate, is only one front in it. As citizens we have to start combating fascist rhetoric in our families and in our communities.

"I think the real culprit is laziness. We all must point the finger at ourselves. I don’t mean the democratic/liberal side of the political spectrum. I mean every single American. Why? Deity politics is why. The two party system en masse regardless of which side of the aisle we are talking about, has lost its roots in democracy and genuine concern for the well being of American people and have rather began employing celebrity or deity tactics and approaches. When people start idolizing political figure heads as an ethereal celebrity or God like status it lends itself to lazy political education. As Manuel Kant says,”the mark of a moral man is always questioning what it is you’re doing is right or wrong.” The same logic should be applied to one’s political flavor of choice. Continually holding those within elected positions to a very high scrutinous standard, continually auditing decisions they make or their actions continually holding those powers that be under a moral, ethical, practical, systematic, logical, and fiscally responsible microscope to ensure the lines don’t get blurred and the core values en masse of said political flavor is congruent across its elected officials. It’s much easier to have a battlecry and sense of loyalty, again, akin to that of celebrity or God like virtue and neglect your own political education, your own fact finding, your own dose of skepticism holding media outlets accountable for their biased practices.

"Blaming tRump voters is the same as sticking your head in the sand and not dealing with reality. There’s a reason why people chose not to vote for Democrats and calling his voters stupid & ignorant is not going to solve the problem and make Democrats more attractive to voters.

One thing I can tell you is that Democrats get a grade of ‘F’, when it comes to communications/messaging. The accomplishments of this administration should have been well known, but the only thing anyone knows about Democrats is the successful negative messaging by Republicans.

Also Democrats have lost voters at the local level because local elections have been ignored for decades by Democrats. When a state like Florida winds up with a Republican supermajority in the legislature and a Republican governor, that report card showing a grade of “F”, is a testament to the inaction and inattention Democrats have paid to local politics.

The only way I can see change coming is if Republicans shoot themselves in the foot with their radical policies causing a lot of harm to a lot of people.

Personally, I do blame Democrats for their failure, their ineffectiveness at messaging. They don’t drill into people’s heads what they’ve accomplished. They don’t repeatedly call out Republicans for taking credit for bills they voted against that benefited their constituents - voters need to know the truth. There is no response to constant misinformation and lies from Republicans. 

 And finally, Democratic ads are not focused enough on what should be their communication’s objectives . Republican ads are like a broken record because they repeat the same basic message ad nauseam, only with different themes.

Until Democrats learn how to properly market and strengthen their brand, their only hope is that Republicans will shoot themselves in the foot with massive blunders. Now what are the chances of that happening?",2024-11-13 02:08:14,negative,0.9061,0.9061,0.0867,0.0072,r/conservative

">Conservative absolutely protect that classist ideology. But don’t attack conservatives themselves, just the belief in “their billionaires.” 

And not just the billionaires, but the hectamillionaires. 

But yes. I agree. 

It's looking like voters once again bought into the notion that a Republican would be better for the economy. 

So we need to combat that by pointing out that Republicans are better for the economy *for the super wealthy.* And explain to them it is the single most important issue for the very large majority of super wealthy Republicans who fund their party. 

In other words, that's what the power behind the party cares about most. getting richer, and they are happy to do it at the expense of everyone else.

There are so many ways to go at this. But I think the biggest one, which you were obviously putting forth here is, the great wealth transfer.

To do that, I think we're going to have to start teaching people some basic economics and what Republican tax cuts have done over time. 

Once they understand that, then show them how Democrats are generally much better for the economy in ways that help the middle and working class.

"I understand what you’re trying to say here. However, I invite you to understand that the act of wanting to change from a pro-slavery nation, into one without, is what’s considered an act of liberalism. The act of wanting to keep, or conserve it, was conservativism. 

Lincoln spoke about this to Southern democrats, who would have been considered conservative at the time: 

“But you say you are conservative—eminently conservative—while we are revolutionary, destructive, or something of the sort. What is conservatism? Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried? We stick to, contend for, the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by “our fathers who framed the Government under which we live”; while you with one accord reject, and scout, and spit upon that old policy, and insist upon substituting something new. True, you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be. You are divided into new propositions and plans, but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers.”
——
Correctly pointing out that even the conservatives at the time were changing things. 

We could even say the same thing about republican “conservatives” today possibly even liberals as well. I’ll single out Abortion as a topic here. Roe v Wade was established law for 50 years. The mere act of wanting to change that is inherently a liberal act. The act of wanting to conserve Roe, is conservativism. I question if most people understand these nuances. 

You could debate whether or not wanting to get rid of Roe was liberal to other definitions. Anti-choice activist claim that they were fighting for the liberties of the unborn child. I’d argue that being at the expense of the mother’s liberties, it is not….but there is some debate to be had there. 

—— 

Anyways, yes Lincoln may have had degrees of rascist views, but that doesn’t make his actions conservative. I would also note that during the Gettysburg address, he would famously borrow and reiterate text from the Declaration that would lay the groundwork for the 13th amendment being legal: 

“Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” 

Lincoln would also issue the Emancipation Proclamation which is also inherently an act of liberalism.",2024-11-10 13:47:09,neutral,0.5943,0.3532,0.5943,0.0524,r/conservative
"I agree with everything you’re saying. 

I do wish to add that it may be difficult to stress any sort of great transfer of wealth. It may be easier to pinpoint certain other areas like money in politics being equal to corruption. I do truly believe that if the next group of candidates all run on that platform and run as democrats in certain areas, and independents in others, that they will win. 

I see the problem being that while classism is the key issue to run on, that classism still exist within the Democratic Party itself as well. And that sounds difficult to fight against, but it may not be so. Social media can amplify any message. Bots interact and amplify them somewhat inorganically. Both republicans and democrats have the issue of advertising. The have to have control groups for those where the rest of us are doing one giant control group in real time. 

So to summarize so far: don’t attack the voters of any demographic, stress the corruption by the wealthy, amplify the messages of classism and the great harm it causes.",2024-11-10 14:37:46,neutral,0.4953,0.4163,0.4953,0.0885,r/conservative

I know it’s not the entire group, it’s not all people’s… but the majority of those groups did prove the republicans right… 

The glass has been shattered for me, leftism is dead, I see how the woke mob has stopped moderates like me from sharing common sense positions, as a result it’s left a void the republicans filled.

This was before the republicans took that stance. But I was attacked and attacked and finally I went.. “yea ok, it doesn’t matter let’s just support them”. But it didn’t fucking matter. We can’t live in idealism, we must live in reality, and in reality, if you tell me that I’m racist for saying all lives matters or white lives matter too in response to Black Lives Matter, that’s just bullshit. 

The leftists need to understand, they gave the right fuel. They created the alt right piepline, and only the left can stop it. But they won’t, because at SOME level, the right was right about he left. Pathetic.

"You don’t need to hope. Instead of doomscrolling and consuming opinions, go educate yourself on how this stuff actually works. I bet you’ll find the actual truth in these matters to be very relieving. People are knee-jerk reacting to all of what just happened. It doesn’t help that politicians (on both sides) amped up people to extreme degrees in their pursuit of office. At the end of the day, remember that they are all politicians. Even the ones you like.

There are very real things to be concerned about. But this idea that Trump will be president forever, we will never vote again, or any similar rhetoric is just that - political rhetoric. We have safeguards in place that will end his presidency on 1/20/29 no matter what a pundit, politician, or rando on the internet thinks. 

This is probably a good time to mention that if you don’t feel like the right people are representing us, then go run for office or support those that do so. We have another important election in just two years for congressional seats, which are definitely very very important for us to right the ship for and win back seats.

If we all sulk in darkness and do nothing but cry in the corner and the R’s end up with a 2/3’s majority (extremely unlikely) then you can start to get very worried.

"My doubts are not based on doomscrolling, but rather what I’ve observed. What I’ve seen is the GOP in lockstep with Trump and doing his bidding for the last 8yrs. They could and should have impeached him, but they didn’t. When he wanted a Justice who was credibly accused of rape, they happily supported him and put that Justice on the court. Similarly, when RGB passed, they completely ignored the past standard of not choosing a new Justice so close to the election and opted to shoehorn in the one of trumps choosing. More recently, when he asked them to tank the border bill, they went right along with it. I’ve watched him commit crimes with almost no repercussions, and attempts to hold him accountable are nearly always stifled. I’ve watched the many times people have said “he can’t do that,” while he does exactly that and gets away with it. I’ve also watched the way people seem to cower in fear of him, like the media and how they’ve gone out of their way to sanewash him, no matter how absurd it was. Those are just a few examples of why I feel the way I do. It isn’t about doomscrolling. This is what I have watched unfold over the past decade, and it does not give me confidence that what you’re saying will hold true. 

I also think this goes beyond Trump. I think the GOP’s lust for power and control is at the root of the matter, and I think that’s the main reason they’ve been happy to go along with whatever Trump wants, as it benefits them, too. There does not seem to be a line they won’t cross to maintain their power and control. I would even go so far as to say they’d abandon Trump if they could, but he holds the keys to the Maga kingdom, which is why they are unlikely to go against him.",2024-11-09 15:43:47,negative,0.6029,0.6029,0.3634,0.0337,r/conservative

They would find out what the truth is instead of believing the alternative facts (lies) that they seem to be getting from news sources that are not telling the truth.

>*An aspiring fascist is the president-elect, again, of the United States. This is our political reality: Donald Trump is going to bring a claque of opportunists and kooks (led by the vice president–elect, a person who once compared Trump to Hitler) into government this winter, and even if senescence overtakes the president-elect, Trump’s minions will continue his assault on democracy, the rule of law, and the Constitution.*

I'm sure most people have seen / heard the Fascist Want-to-Be Dictator, Insurrectionist, and Twice Impeached 34x Convicted Felon and Convicted Sexual Abuser (with additional charges pending) Republican Cult Leader and now Presidential Elect Trump's rallies or speeches?

I do not look forward to all of the awful and disgusting changes he plans on implementing.

It seems America forgot his disastrous first presidency.

He has been listed as one of the worst presidents in the history of the US.

>*Survey of 154 scholars places 45th president behind even ‘historically calamitous chief executives’ linked to civil war. Donald Trump finished 45th and rock bottom of a list ranking US presidents by greatness, trailing even “historically calamitous chief executives” who failed to stop the civil war or botched its aftermath.*

"Unnmm.

VP Harris is 100 M times better than Trump.

VP Harris wiped the floor with him at the debate.

Trump is a current INSURRECTIONIST who talks about revenge and hatred and fear mongering. He talks about removing the licenses of broadcasters to shut them up - because he does not like to be challenged. He wants to fire federal employees and replace them with Trump loyalists.

He talks about current immigration LAW as if VP Harris wrote it. She did not (neither did President Biden). He discusses doing away with the press.

He wants to destroy the checks and balances our US Constitution provides.

In a rally the other day, he mimicked falatio on a microphone.

[Trump appears to emulate ‘sex act’ on microphone after he melts down over technical difficulties](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-microphone-video-milwaukee-rally-wisconsin-b2640757.html).

He does such awful and abhorrent  things that it's hardly mentioned.

Can you imagine if VP Harris said she'd take revenge on people she did not like or mimicked falatio on a microphone or said she'd be a dictator and place people in interment camps?

Why does Trump get away with it?

Why is his behavior and plans to destroy the US Constitution better than someone promoting the law, freedom of the press, and positive actions?

Moving the country forward.

I remember when Trump was president.

I NEVER felt safe.

He just did so many awful things. He is morally corrupt.

I can't imagine four years of his dictatorship and revenge seeking crap.

So what you describe as a symbiotic relationship with the media is actually parasitic, and by that nature, you are deceived. 

In your deception you elect Democrats who, along with vested interest from these media giants, perpetuate their control over the narrative by way of enacting policies that FURTHER their control over the political and media narrative. Have you stopped to think how utterly, dramatically, this country has changed, socially, in the last 16 years? That sort of change is damaging for a society whether you believe it or not. We cannot, absolutely cannot allow ourselves to be dissolved by caustic agents of extreme change. You've been issued a culture of government dependency and you never even realized it, because you're asking for it to continue. 

Trump is not the fucking antichrist. He's a symbol of Americans who are recognizing this, speaking for them en masse. His media tactics changing, reflects an understanding that people have realized what you do not and have decided to take action to preserve a future where ALL belief systems and ways of life are supported, not just yours.

"Except it doesn't bring back manufacturing jobs. Trump already tried this in 2018 and we ended up in a trade war where prices for farmers here went up and we had a net negative effect on manufacturing jobs for the first time in a very, very long time. China hit us with retaliatory tariffs and we ended up having to pay around $30 billion to bail out our farmers because of it. 

The Federal Reserve Board found that the tariffs caused a reduction in manufacturing employment of 1.4%. Modest gains (0.3%) achieved by shielding domestic producers from foreign competition were “more than offset” by rising production costs for manufacturers who used steel as an input (-1.1%) and retaliatory tariffs (-0.7%).

Federal Reserve data recorded approximately 12.4 million manufacturing jobs when Trump became president in January 2017 and 12.2 million when he left in January 2021. There were 12.9 million manufacturing jobs in September 2024, although job creation in the manufacturing sector and manufacturing’s share of total employment are lower than pre-tariff rates.

Economy-wide, Oxford Economics estimated in 2021 that the tariffs and resulting trade war cost 245,000 jobs and 0.5% of GDP while reducing real incomes by $675 per household. Also, when Chinese goods become expensive to buy, American manufacturers of those same goods will ALSO INCREASE THEIR PRICES.  It's a perfect opportunity for them to raise prices to keep up with competitors. Seriously, why shift production back to the US when they can just shift the burden onto the consumer to protect profits? Plus, when things become more expensive, demand for those goods decreases, which reduces production and can lead to job cuts in manufacturing. This literally already happened when he did it the first time. Those tariffs are still in place.",2024-11-08 13:21:11,negative,0.4907,0.4907,0.4196,0.0897,r/conservative

Each state has their own absentee standards on who qualifies to get a mail in ballot, and in 2020, the mail in ballot qualifications were more lenient with covid. Less obstacles to voting usually means more votes cast and we arguably had more obstacles this time.

Most countries are dealing with something similar in their elections.

It was proven that there was NO LEGITIMATE reason for us to have our ballots challenged but still, we were made to do provisional ballots. Apparently our provisional ballots don't even get counted until a week after the election. If we weren't challenged then we would have been able to vote normally. So our votes literally didn't count and this was a way of them making sure our voices weren't heard and votes didn't count. It's voter suppression. I've spoken to several agencies about this and NPR did an article about it which talks about the trial I was in. So yes, there was some hinky shit that went down to prevent us from voting

"Let me preface this with some background. My parents were die hard conservative conspiracy theorists and taught me some really toxic ways of thinking. They were the type to believe Obama is an illegal immigrant, that some funeral home chain was recycling dead people's SSI#s to win the 2008 and 2012 elections for Obama, and that Bush did 9/11. They taught me to only believe things I (ie they) wanted to believe regardless of the evidence, especially if it was in any way tied to their religion. I choose daily to fact check myself and push back on lazy answers that feel good largely because I refuse to be them. I choose daily to always follow the evidence, even when I don't like it or want it to be true.


For now, not all the votes have been counted and there's not a lot of concrete evidence so I'm suspending most judgement of why the election happened this way until the final votes are counted. I do know that gerrymandering is a huge problem and has been for a very long time so it's safe to expect that some amount of district fuckery contributed via the electoral college. I know for a fact that increasing the difficulty of voting and doing things like purging voter rolls is simarly a longstanding problem so it's safe to expect that that is contributing a bit as well. But I also know how many people were spewing stupid (within the context of what was at stake this election) shit about democratic candidates' weak if not genocide supportive stance on Palestine. I also know that US culture is still pretty mysogenistic and that if they didn't elect a white woman over Trump, it was a stretch to expect a black woman to succeed either.

It's a bleak thing to face, but I'm just having to accept  that there are a lot of very stupid liberal people who didn't think this choice through and helped cost us all our freedoms.",2024-11-09 01:03:53,negative,0.7874,0.7874,0.1927,0.0199,r/conservative

"Yes, that. But I also think something more...I don't want to say alarming...I'll say depressing is happening. After the election in '12, Limbaugh got on his radio program and said, ""We are outnumbered and losing ground."" The results looked bleak for Republicans. Obama had taken Ohio twice, Florida twice. The blue wall was impenetrable. New York and California had been lost forever to the Democrats. The path forward for Republicans appeared to be nothing but losses.

Look at us now. Florida and Ohio are no longer swing states. Democrats have lost those for the rest of our lifetimes, I imagine. Texas isn't turning blue despite signs that things were changing. Georgia appeared to be an Indiana-like blip for Democrats and regressed back to the mean this year. North Carolina had a split ticket for crying out loud, and the only reason that comes to mind is the fact that the Republican was a black man. If he were a white guy with the same ridiculous positions, he'd have probably cleaned house. The only hope Democrats have going forward is to put all of their efforts into the blue wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and hope that the dwindling hold they have on Minnesota and Virginia doesn't slip.

The point I'm trying to make is that we're outnumbered and losing ground. Everyone's been asking the question of what can be done about it, and frankly, I don't think there's anything. There's nothing we can do without sacrificing our morals. I'm saying this as a former Republican. Sure, it's been 20 years since I was a Republican, but I remember the reasons why I defected. The party felt more and more morally bankrupt to me, and the personalities on talk radio and Fox News simply reaffirmed it for me. I could no longer in good conscience associate myself with people who said, felt, and tried to legislate things I believed were discriminatory and morally reprehensible. I don't want the Democrats to go down that path. We're already a big-tent party, so we don't exclude anyone. That includes white men and women. Democrats believe in policies that are beneficial for everyone.

Over the last couple of days, though, I've seen a lot of posts asking what Democrats can do to bring in more white men. I mean, what else can be done? That's my question. I'm asking this as a white man. I don't want the Democratic party to sacrifice their morality by embracing racism and misogyny. Then, I'd leave that party, too. Can the party do a better job of reaching out to whites? Yeah, I guess, but other than proposing policies that boost the middle class (higher wages, union support, housing solutions) and priortize education (including student loan forgiveness), I don't know what that is. I don't know how Democrats can go after the white vote without excluding marginalized groups. Because that's not what we do. Prospertity for all. But many whites don't want that.

"I commented elsewhere that I didn't get what happened because everyone I knew voted for Harris, and someone replied to me to basically insinuate that some people lied to me. I started to really think about the few folks who I hadn't actually heard from one way or the other, and realized I made some assumptions about some folks voting for Harris who well and truly might not have.

say what you want but the economy prior to Covid under Trump was the best it had been for quite some time. A lot more things were affordable whether you want to be believe that was Trump or not. Your opinion. 

But when you have most of America struggling to make ends meet, and you have democratic politicians who are trying to tell you that, no, benefiting someone who came into the country illegally deserves the breaks you feel or better yet funding Ukraine is more of a priority than the actual citizens who are going through hardships. you work your ass off and deserve funding while simultaneously struggling to make ends meet. you’re gonna lose that voter 9 out of 10 times. It’s a slap in the face to them in their mind. 

Hell even legalized Latinos are even saying enough is enough. Shocker people. Legal citizens who immigrated and went through immense vetting and due process do not want to see people skipping the line. You’re slapping them in the face. Southern Texas boarders mostly Latino. All shifted major right. You know why? They are fucking exhausted seeing people go through the borders with no vetting, they are experiencing crime skyrocket, there are many more reasons as to why. But fundamentally most of America has had enough of it. And that’s what you all saw.

>What can Grab Your Wallet do for me?  
The main thing Grab Your Wallet can offer is our ability to reach out to companies and try to get them to stop doing bad things. For instance, if you tell us that your employer is creating an unsafe or hostile work environment in some way, we can reach out to the company and—without mentioning your name or sharing any identifying details about you—we can say, ""Hey company, we've heard that you're doing a bad thing. Are you, in fact, doing this bad thing? And, if you are doing this bad thing, do you plan on continuing to do this bad thing?""  
  
In some cases, this simple inquiry alone can prompt a behavior and/or policy change. In other cases, additional steps may be needed.  
  
Examples of times we've reached out to companies on workers' behalf in the past and were able to make a positive change include:  
  
A national drug store chain that, in the beginning of the pandemic, was telling workers they were not allowed to wear masks because it would ""scare customers.""

"I'll offer some small predictions, if it helps. Republicans, always ALWAYS take any victory, no matter how marginal, and see it as an absolute mandate. Now, they control all the branches again, but remember how much they got done in 2016? Yeah, McCain isn't around to tank an ACA repeal, but think about how taking people's insurance away is going to go over.  
  
In reality, these bozos have about 12 months to get anything done. Most of the crap in Project 2025 is going to be DOA once it sees the light of day. By December 2025 there are going to be a lot of people in Congress who've been hearing it from their constituents, and they'll be worried about reelection.

Same as the last time. Most likely the House will flip back in '26, and that will be the end of that.

Yes, most of the grownups who were in the White House the last time won't be there this time. But remember how chaotic and incompetent it was, even with that? The idiots will be fully in charge of the asylum this time. What makes you think these guys will be any more effective with a second shot? None of these people know how to get anything done.

Let's take immigration: they say they're going to forcibly deport 10 million people? How, exactly, are they going to do that? These guys don't believe in expertise, and they certainly don't understand large-scale logistics. We don't have any mechanism for moving that many people and the cost alone will be ridiculous.

They're going to fire a bunch of career civil servants? What about the ones who live in contested congressional districts?

Musk is going to be the ""government efficiency expert""? What about when he targets some powerful Senator's pet project?

Take a look at P2025 and ask yourself how implementing these policies would happen in the real world. Most of it won't.

Look, they're still going to do a colossal amount of damage to our institutions. That's to be expected. But don't make them into bigger boogeymen than they already are.

"Now that I've had more time to process and digest, I tend to agree with you.

Trump will absolutely go after his political enemies. He's hell bent on revenge. The Obamas, Bidens, Liz Cheney. He's gonna force the House to investigate them and drag them to testify, just like Hillary. It's gonna be hard for them to legislate anything when they're tied up all day in ridiculous kangaroo court hearings.

Immigration...I do think he does hand the reins off to Stephen Miller. I do think they will do sweeps of entire Hispanic neighborhoods in large cities. However, that being said, I do think they will encounter significant pushback, especially in Democratic states. Trump talks a big game but ultimately, the country needs states like California, Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois, etc. Pritzker and Newsom are not going to roll over and play dead. What is Trump gonna do? Deploy the military on our own states? Even with yes men, that is a bad look and most Republicans will shy away from turning the military on our own people. One thing I read that gave me hope is that unlike Germany in the 1930s or Russia or Cambodia is that we do have strong Democratic governors with pull. 

Tariffs...I think he will impose tariffs and that it will have severe economic consequences. However, it will also affect billionaires and the Waltons and Jeff Bezos are not about to see their companies nose dive over this. So I think it will be curbed...to a degree. 

Our best hope is he has endless hearings and goes to play golf until his obesity and age catch up with him on the course. 

Of course I thought Harris would win so I could be totally wrong. But remember. Trump doesn't want to govern. He wants to stay out of prison and go after his ""enemies list.""",2024-11-08 14:50:58,negative,0.5244,0.5244,0.4105,0.0651,r/conservative

""Change"" means different things for different people and people want change that will improve their lives. Trump's campaign pushed change. He told people what they wanted to hear, and they rewarded him for it.

>And it's also why Harris' slogan was a fucking disaster: ""We're not going back"". This is exactly what people want though. They want to go back to before inflation and before things cost so much. They want to go back to when people didn't call them fascists. It doesn't matter the reasons for those things happening now. What matters is what the people want. Sure, she tried to address those things, by pointing out what Biden has passed that helped the economy and protections for various civil rights. But it's a horrible campaign strategy. People do not view the economy and their own personal expenses as the same thing. Ask people how the CHIPS Act or how the BBB Act has improved their lives, you wont get an answer. So telling them that those things did is useless. And Harris ever saying that she'll continue Biden's work or do the same things was incredibly stupid. You don't tell people who are demanding change (whatever that ""change"" may be) that you're not going to change. Of course they wont vote for you then.

4. Immigration.  We can have some reasonable number of people in each year, and help,them.  it can’t be EVERYONE and we have to prosecute and reject obvious criminals.  In other words, hardworking mother with 2 kids, sure.  Former known drug hitman, maybe we should think twice.

I think Democrats have trouble separating what they think ""ought"" to be the case from what ""is"" the case. What ""is"" the case is that, it seems voters won't elect a woman candidate. But Democrats will keep running women candidates over and over again because they think that voters ""ought"" to vote for them. This is a problem that needs to be fixed if Democrats want to win elections more.

I find it kind of funny Democrats will attack people voting third party because ""they could never win"" but they'll happily nominate candidates who equally could never win, just because, in their opinion, their candidate ""ought"" to win in a just world.

By the way, I voted Democrat and never voted third party in my life. But do you not see the similarity in nominating and voting for futile candidates just because ""in a sane country they would win""? It's the same attitude.",2024-11-07 22:42:24,negative,0.7296,0.7296,0.2436,0.0269,r/conservative

"It's not the biggest issue in the country right now. The economy and the border are. 

Saying that women will never be able to have an abortion is disingenuous. It is left up to the states. Amendment 4 on the Florida Ballot would have allowed abortions up to viability. It needed 60% to pass and received 57.2%. I voted for Amendment 4.  It didn't pass. So we're back to the 6 week ban which might as well be an outright ban in Florida. Most women, myself included, didn't even know we were pregnant before 6 weeks. Ob/gyns won't see a woman before 6 weeks. It's absolute nonsense. 

I understand why women are upset. I am upset that the religious right derailed amendment 4. But the positive side is we received 57.2% of the vote. And I'll keep fighting and showing up at rallies and writing state and local officials about access to abortion in Florida.

Yeah. This was not a fair election. 

If you're truly a liberal, you should understand that the US Constitution and system laws is a social contract. Where we all agree to abide by it because we want democracy. 

The Republicans broke that contract, over and over again. The senators violated their oaths by not convicting Trump. Judges allowed him to go unprosecuted for his crimes. Republican leaders promoted him during the Republican primaries, despite the fact they know he is morally and psychologically unfit for office, instead of choosing Nikki Haley.

And Trump created for voters a fictional reality of who he is, what he would do for voters, and who Harris is. It was a misinformation campaign of propaganda and lies.

So no. Everything about the 2024 election was bad faith participation by Trump and other Republican leaders. Particularly because their primary goal was to elect a tyrant.

It’s not a women’s right to kill their unborn babies. Regardless of whether you believe that or not, the GOP isn’t aiming to put a “nationwide ban” on abortion. The GOP wants to delegate the issue of abortion to the states. Roe v Wade was a shit ruling. There’s no constitutional standing for abortion. It shouldn’t be a federal law. Let democracy do its thing. States can democratically decide laws governing abortion.

- Very likely started a global economic war…

Domestic companies outsourcing labor costs American’s job opportunities. We could tax these products in order to incentivize American production/jobs.

Illegal immigration has run rampant over past few years. Tariffs could be used as a way to incentivize Mexico to cooperate with our immigration policies so that we can curb illegal immigration.

Other countries (not just China) tax our exports so why don’t we tax theirs. Let’s negotiate a balanced trade. 

Finally Biden just recently put tariffs on a number of Chinese imports. Stolen from CNN (so maybe you’ll believe it)… “tariff rate will go up to 100% on electric vehicles, to 50% on solar cells and to 25% on electrical vehicle batteries, critical minerals, steel, aluminum, face masks and ship-to-shore cranes”.

How the fuck so? As soon as Obama was elected, that led to the Tea Party and 2012 barely kept an *incumbent* in office -- incumbents rarely lose until 2020. Bush Sr even got into office by association with Reagan. Then in 2016 the most absurd, audacious birther was elected.

Is this your first election? Do you not know history at all? 

> Conservatives fed up with democratic policies is what lead to Trump.

Conservatives weren't enough to elect Trump. It's the basis of our swing states. What policy of Biden's, specifically, do you think led to higher inflation? You people point to Biden stopping *some* drilling for oil -- why is the price of milk and bread suddenly much higher because of that? Did Biden have a policy to defund bread subsidies I wasn't aware of? Are you not aware that Trump's new economic czar, or whatever position he puts Elon into that Elon is wildly unqualified for, owns and runs an electric car company? Measures to address climate change got an undeniable no from the American people yesterday, but one of the biggest profiteers from this is heavily invested in green energy? 

Well, congrats, independents, on voting for cheaper bread over women's rights. Bread might be the one thing that doesn't go up in price with Trump's dead-stupid ""make China/Mexico pay for it"" tariffs that didn't work after 2016 and won't work now.

> Conservatives only wish to prevent GAC for minors (because they aren't old enough to make permanent choices) and ban them from sports (which is fair because biological men shouldn't be beating women at their own sport)

Things they don't want and things that don't happen. It's the same story all over again. Remember protecting women (even if they didn't want it)? Remember homosexual conversation camps? Conservatives are in such a rush to protect people they don't know in ways they assume they want, and didn't actually give a shit what they're saying. Then they cherry pick out of context or conservative funded studies to back up the vote point they've already chosen.

The reality is that this is just culture war by proxy. Conservatives are so out of touch with anyone who isn't themselves or someone like them, they don't even know how to relate to trans people. Trans people would like to be able to have the *choice* (remember abortion?) to discuss this stuff with their doctor (abortion) and make an informed decision. This isn't your business, and it never has been. But conservatives are so worried that ""those crazy commie liberals"" are harming kids, they didn't actually look at what they want. 

For example

https://www.hrc.org/resources/get-the-facts-on-gender-affirming-care

> Transgender and non-binary people who begin transitioning during childhood or adolescence work closely with parents and health care providers — including mental health providers — to determine which changes to make at a given time that are age-appropriate and in the best interest of the child. At all stages, parents, young people and medical professionals make decisions together, and no permanent medical interventions happen until a transgender person is old enough to give truly informed consent.

That's what you said you wanted, right? So what's the problem? 

> Transgender and non-binary people typically do not have gender-affirming surgeries before the age of 18. In some rare exceptions, 16 or 17 year-olds have received gender-affirming surgeries in order to reduce the impacts of significant gender dysphoria, including anxiety, depression, and suicidality. However, this is limited to those for whom the surgery is deemed clinically necessary after discussions with both their parents and doctors, and who have been consistent and persistent in their gender identity for years, have been taking gender-affirming hormones for some time, who have undergone informed consent discussions and have approvals from both their parents and doctors, and who otherwise meet standards of care criteria (such as those laid out by WPATH). 

So you know more than the medical professionals, that's what you're saying? 

> However, evidence-based standards of care exist to ensure that no one, regardless of their age, undergoes any permanent, irreversible changes without informed consent and careful consultation with medical and mental health care providers.

> If trans people commit suicide over this, it's no different if conservatives committed suicide over Kamala winning.

Are you actually comparing the ""plight of conservatives in America"" to trans people? I'm not even going to bother looking up suicide statistics for conservatives, that's a thoroughly ridiculously argument.

> They will be fine if they can wait until adulthood to transition

Except the ones who won't, which are very rare and none of your goddamn business anyway. 

> And understand they have unfair advantages against women in sports.

And the women you're targeting with that are still fighting back https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/06/olympic-boxer-imane-khelif-takes-legal-action-over-male-chromosomes-claims

Keep in mind, Algeria has laws to imprison LGBTQ people, and vigilantes have killed them. So well you're making these claims without factual basis, Imane Khelif's life is on the line. Guess you didn't care about that.

And keep in mind that this ""gender advantage"" you're talking about didn't help her in 2018, when she finished 17th, or 2019 when she finished 33rd. I guess she just started transitioning in 2020 or so, with the support of the Algerian medical community?

"It will be spun as an attack that left wokism is trying to destroy them because of their diets that avoid meat. 

""Folks, let me tell you. We've got some big beautiful farmland here in America. I'm talking about ears of corn bigger than your head, yuuuge tracts of land, you've never seen anything like it. I was talking to some business people, good friends of mine, I was talking to them and they're all saying *Oh, Donald. We know you love the farmers. We know no one cares more about our farmers than Trump. But the people, they're just not buying beef any more. They're not buying steaks. We have big beautiful steaks, so juicy. Can you please help us?"". I say, ""Of course farmers, of course ranchers. I can help..."" rancheros they call them sometimes you know. Sometimes they call them that when they deal mostly with - with different kinds of workers, not everyone is a rancher. If you're... swarthy... you've got a tan, not like mine, mine's beautiful, theirs is from being in the sun too much, way too much sun, so I say ""Why not use sunscreen? It protects from the V-rays... The U-UV Rays""... it's like the eclipse I had last time, The Great American Eclipse they callled it back then becuase under Trump America was truly great... if you have a... unique accent.... they call you ranchero. I don't know why, I just use the English. I say *this is America we use the English here.* But the farmers I tell them, Trump is back. Trump is here. So I come back to the White House talking with some of my guys and I ask them, ""Why isn't anyone eating beef anymore? It's delicious. Has the iron.. the protein. Protein folks, you need it for muscle. If you don't have it you become weak, your brain dissolves, your organs fail. And they say, ""Well Donald, we know you're a great communicator. We know you use the best words, why can't you convince the people to buy more steaks? You've done it before, Trump steaks. Big beautiful juicy delicious Trump steaks. And then I realized you know who doesn't eat beef? Who doesn't eat meat? All those hippie dippy leftists on the coasts, in the cities, probably have never seen a cow in their lives. You point at a cow and ask them what it is and they say *I don't know* they say *I've seen it on TV but not in real life.* All these woke vegans and vegetarians trying to get our kids to stop eating meat, to stop eating beef. They take it out of schools, they say it's global warming from cow poop. They say, ""Don't have a burger you're killing the polar seltzer bears. They won't be able to give Coke to Santa anymore on holiday commercials if you eat that burger."" I tell you folks, it's what they're doing to your kids. Making them weak, making them lazy, making them dumb. You think a bunch of wimpy vegans would have killed Bin Aladdin? Bin Laden?  They're trying to make us weak, make us susceptible to their real owners, the Iranians, the Chinese, the Indians... the Indians folks, they practically worship the cow. It's a god to them. They put flowers on them, sweep the floor for them - then they cook only vegetables and you end up weak and in a diaper like that Ghandi guy... he could have fought, he couldn't have fought the British like we did in 18...177...76. Americans? Patriots? We eat meat, we eat beef, we're strong, we fight back and kick ass and look good doing it. These people though, that's why they want to make your kids stop eating meat, because it makes it easier to control. You think Xi Jingping-pong wants his people to eat beef like we do? They want just the beans, just the soy, the tofu... never tried it. Someone i was at a restaurant once and someone ordered it and I saw it and said ""You're eating a sponge... that's not food you're eating a sponge""... that's what they do people. Kim Jong Un barely feeds his people at all and he gets 98, 99, 100% 200% 300% of the vote every time. It's all about control, folks, and the left is coming for your burgers. Think about how sad... how sad your 4th of July will be. Everyone shows up expecting a big barbecue, lots of meat and they see it and say ""Oh, it's just salad. Oh it's just vegetables. This is boring, I'll go home and just do nothing."" That's a Democrat on July 4th. No fireworks, no barbecue, just salad and woke. Maybe you like... it's not for me...

This number has no bearing on how many of those crossings were apprehended, nor does it have any bearing on how many people apprehended were crossing the border illegally. For example, if someone crossed the border but was caught, they do not remain in the US as an illegal immigrant. Similarly, if someone crossed the border and claimed asylum, they are not here illegally. While someone has an asylum application ongoing, they are lawfully present in the US.

It's the economy, stupid. But, also, the economy is very complicated and none of them are good at talking about it, let alone understanding it. Her policies and ideas she pitched might have helped, but ... when compared to the absolute nonsense that was brainfarted by the fascist (tariffs! No taxes!  Elon cutting the budget!) ... all we heard from her was the same old promises we've heard from Dems for, well, it seems like generations.

Based on what they said on their stumps, Trump was the more radical candidate.

Which, well, isn't how presidents usually improve economic situations.

But it excited the voters and he won the popular vote ... so, I bet this is the very last time any American president who commits to re-election drops out of the race in the third quarter.

If he had stepped aside at the beginning of the election cycle (like he said he would before he was elected the first time) and the Dems could find out who they supported in a primary ... I have a feeling Harris would have performed well in that primary but might not have won.

And whoever did would have more time to craft a platform that explains our current economy and offers solutions to improve it.

Instead, we get two bros and a million syncophants (Trump, Elon, Joe Rogan, Ted Cruz, etc etc) deadset on knocking it down. It being the government. 

The Republican Party is now the Trump Party and strangely, American voters love this and ... they're a bit more anarchist than all those Free Palestine obsessed college kids.

So, Trump got the anarchist vote (or they went third party). He got the hatred vote. He got the Christians (even though he's not the better Christian). 

Harris got more donations and celebrities but voters didn't choose her.

It can feel like it is because she is a woman.

But America is a lie. The day after, we see who we are. Never underestimate the stupidity of the electorate. Or, the fear of a female planet.

That is really the most important thing: the unpopularity of the administration. The other important thing is that she had little time to do a campaign, and the one she ran was not great. You combine those two and there's big trouble.

The analysis of the votes is off. Trump had a massive increase in votes from 2016 to 2020 and he did not go from being a woman to a man; it was just a very different environment, that is what contributed to far higher turnout which affected both candidates in 2020. Harris has underperformed Biden, yes, but again, Biden 2024 was going to massively underperform Biden 2020.

It is not ""highly unlikely"" that turnout was lower and Trump converted people from D to R. I'm not sure why you'd think that, it's actually very likely, and there was lots of data pointing to Trump converting voters. I'll give you one of the better examples: Jon Ralston, a well-known reporter in Nevada who analyzes races, gave his predictions on who'd win the state, by looking at the early vote, comparing different areas depending on whether they're D or R, things like that. Based on his analysis (which has usually been good), he predicted Harris would win by a narrow margin.

However, Harris lost the state. Afterward, this is what he said:

>The Democratic machine DID turn out its voters — young, Hispanics, nonpartisans who leaned left — but they didn’t do what they usually do: vote for the Democrats. Why? They better figure that out. Former President Donald Trump came close in Clark County, which is inconceivable. How did that happen? No taxes on this tip: The core of the party didn’t just underperform; they turned their backs.

"while I'm sure sex/gender play a part in it, I don't think a woman president is really *that* out of reach for the US -- I don't think the margins of these elections really reflect that. In comparison, here's the margins for past US elections, many of which have much wider differences than Hillary or Kamala.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_by_popular_vote_margin

Democrats DO have a communication problem, part of which is described by many as coming across as insincere, pandering, or excluding important groups. A big group here is young men, who often feel like they're not being respected, listened to, or being blamed for ""white privilege"" even when a lot of them feel like they've never received many benefits of this ""privilege"" or even ever asked for it.

Among these young men, there's a pervading negative view of feminism and ""wokeness"" as some call it, and I think it tends to come across worse when it's from a woman (the element of sexism). And it didn't help that Harris' very short campaign lacked a lot of direction and seemed (to me at least) to focus hard on those ""woke"" social issues.

And another thing -- I was watching a live stream during the election on YouTube called ""The Rest is Politics,"" and one of the contrarian commentators predicted Trump would win. He said that one thing many, many people get wrong about politics is that the ""minutiae"" of politics is something that most people simply don't care or know about. Rather, they care about the economy first and foremost, which is understandable -- it's hard to care about others' issues when you don't feel secure in your own life.

How different might things have come out if Harris had come down hard with a concrete plan to fix the economy, make people feel listened to and secure? We'll probably never know.

Sanctions on Russia, aimed at pressuring its economy due to the invasion of Ukraine, led to higher energy prices, global supply chain disruptions, inflation, and commodity shortages, which worsened economic conditions in the U.S. during Biden's presidency.  This economic turmoil was further intensified by the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had already caused significant strain on global supply chains, led to labor shortages, and required substantial government spending to support businesses and individuals. The pandemic-driven spending increased inflation and disrupted the recovery, making it harder to stabilize the economy. Additionally, sanctions on Russia disrupted global markets, particularly in energy and agriculture, driving up costs for goods and services.

"Myself and my family are from the panhandle from FL and I'm torn what to do. On the extreme end there is always immigration to a place like the UK, Europe, Australia. On the less extreme, there is moving to a blue or even purple state. Even before this election, we knew we wanted to eventually leave FL. The hurricanes and homeowners insurance has gotten insane and we want somewhere less disaster prone and affected by climate change.

But in light of this election, we have strong political motivations to leave. We have a small daughter that we don't feel comfortable raising in a red state anymore. I know ppl say stay in your state, fix it. There is no fixing it. My entire adult life, our state and especially our area has only gotten redder and redder. I've long felt my political voice is an inconsequential whisper in a sea of dissenting screams. I'm honestly sick and tired of my vote being tossed out by the electoral college every presidential election as well. So at this point I'm looking at guarding our quality of life. 

I just don't know where to go. My Mom and her partner live in PA. Thinking maybe somewhere near there, maybe somewhere more blue though like the New England area. It would be nice if some of us left leaning people could coordinate together to all move to a purple state, effectively turning it blue.

"We shop mostly at Aldi and Stater brothers and probably spend about $150 a week. 

I honestly don’t know about utilities because I don’t regularly look. SoCal is pretty temperate so we don’t typically have the AC/heat on. I’d say maybe $200 combined?

Gas is like $4/gallon right now, but could be as high as $4.50. 

At the end of the day these expenses aren’t a big deal. Housing is by far the biggest added expense, which is about 2x. 

Every bit of my increased pay goes to these expenses, meaning my family is really living the same quality of life we did in Ohio, but we’re in SoCal, which is amazing.

https://youtu.be/IbOws9UBNNo?si=XRY-dTM6y6tnRAac

The whole idea of an abortion ban comes from Project 2025 which is a heritage foundation thing. 

https://youtu.be/S3ZLq2pLDQE?si=d1mG0AJVhtmuWQhX

Trump's agenda is detailed in Agenda 47, not project 2025. 

During Trump's first term, since he was on the Republican side, he ended up working alot with the heritage foundation. The most significant collaboration they had together was the Heritage Foundation gave him a list of conservative judges to appoint since Trump didn't really have any familiarity with any one to nominate, so since a bunch of people vouched for the list he went with it.

But all the heritage foundation can do is propose policy ideas, and then Trump will decide whether to consider them or not, if he even listens to them. He thinks some of their Ideas are too radical and he had been moving away from them with all the controversy.

3. As far as OSHA goes, Trump (as far as I know) hasn't made any claims about doing anything to OSHA. I could be wrong, though. When he first came into office, Obama had just introduced new OSHA regulations, and Trump repealed some of them.

https://oshadefensereport.com/2019/07/08/fate-of-obama-era-osha-regulations-and-enforcement-policies-under-the-trump-administration/

4. I haven't seen anything new about OSHA like I said above.

5. Tax cuts - you will often hear from democrats that Trump only gave tax cuts for the rich, and that is all he will do, but that is false. It's propaganda repeated as truth.

The reality is that when Trump introduced his tax cuts, everyone got a tax cut.

Now, those tax cuts were different based on your income bracket.

Because those who made little money were already taxed a small amount, the benefit didn't seem to amount to much.

As you made more money through the middle class, your tax cuts increased, and you got to keep more money.

Now, where the dishonesty comes into play is the idea that the rich got the biggest tax cuts. In a way, it was true. They used to pay 40-50% tax, and it went down to 25% tax. This was the biggest difference as far as the numerical percentage goes.

But where the dishonesty comes into play is this: under the original tax code, a wealthy person would be expected to pay 40-50% in taxes. But, there were a bunch of hidden loopholes where you could claim charity or hardships for business, etc. that would let you get your tax obligation down to 0%, and you wouldn't actually pay any taxes.

All of the rich exploited those loopholes. Even Donald Trump. They never had to actually pay any taxes.

Trump's tax code reduced their tax obligation to 25%, but it also eliminated all of the loopholes. So none of the rich could do anything to avoid paying taxes anymore, and they all had to pay up. So it is disingenuous to say that he gave his rich buddies tax breaks because all the rich people could no longer avoid paying their taxes, and many rich people were mad at him because they liked using the loopholes to avoid paying anything altogether.

5B: Tax cuts only create deficit if you don't decrease spending. If Trump cuts taxes, but keeps spending like we do today, the deficit and inflation will go through the roof.

But Trump's plan is to reduce the size of the federal government and alot of the extraneous programs, foreign aid, social security, and benefits for illegal immigrants, etc in order to balance the cuts.

6: Tariffs are a strategic measure. No one likes being tariffed. The reason that Trump did tariffs in the past was because the trade deal that Obama signed with the oceanic countries in the Pacific really disadvantaged the U.S. and we were losing money as we traded with those nations. Like, they could tax and tariff us, but we couldn't negotiate better prices without their consent, stuff like that.

People think that Trump uses tariffs like a tax. Meaning he wants to make money off of them. But that's not why, and that not the point.

The reason for tariffs is to force the other party to respond. Case in point, in the past, Trump increased tariffs on China because China refused to renegotiate the original trade deal. So Trump, in an effort to make China want to renegotiate, put tariffs on soybeans. China refused to budge, and it ended up hurting our farmers because our farmers rely on those imports. Trump ended up subsidizing the farmers to try and help them and kept increasing tariffs until China finally relented and we got a new trade deal.

But the point of the tariffs wasn't to make money off of them, they were only in place until a goal was reached.

He tariffed Mexico because U.S. companies had fired their American workers in order to manufacture for cheaper in Mexico, and then import those cars to the U.S.

Trump wanted manufacturing jobs to come back for our workers, so he tariffed Mexico until the U.S. companies reopened their plants and hired American workers again, and then he removed the Tariffs.

In Europe, he tariffed the cars that we imported from them. The reason why is because they tariffed us, but we didn't tariff them. So European cars sold great here because they weren't too expensive and Europe made money from our market, but over in Europe, American cars never sell cuz they are so much more expensive than their domestic vehicles due to the tariffs. So they made money off of us, but not vice versa.

Europe governments were mad at the tariffs cuz they liked the way things were, obviously. 

But in truth, the European car companies had no idea that American cars were taxed like that. They eventually supported Trump cuz they said it should be an even playing field with our friends. And eventually Europe removed their tariffs and so we removed ours.

But that is the reality behind how Trump uses Tariffs. It's not a tax for long term income. It's a tool for negotiating deals.

From what I understand, he wants to have American companies buy and sell within the U.S. first so that products are cheaper for us. Currently, many American companies manufacture and produce outside the U.S. because they exploit cheap foreign labor. Tariffs will make the cheapest option for a company to produce and sell inside the U.S., and thus more jobs and money for American workers.

This combined with income tax cuts will allow people to spend more money domestically, and we will get more taxes from sales tax.

And that is where our increased tax revenue will come from, sales tax.

That is his plan.",2024-11-07 07:55:26,neutral,0.52,0.4309,0.52,0.0491,r/conservative

Thank you for being honest. If the democratic candidate was more middle grounded then I think there would have been a real shot.

I think if the candidate was less pushy about abortion trans guns and immigration you’d have a winner. If abortion was pushed for when medically necessary but not as a form of birth control that would be a good angle. Allow adults to do what they want by becoming trans but don’t allow anyone under 18 or 21.

Trump has served a term in 2016. The most damaging effect of that were his supreme court nominations

Biden spent a lot of time in his term appointing federal judges to counter that, approximately 213 judges. 

Trump will likely put a lot of energy into appointing federal circuit judges, but that will take his entire term to shift balance. Currently there are some 370 democrat appointed district judges compared to 267 Rep. appointed judges. 

As far as concentration camps and turning the military on civilians, that's not up to the president. People will be waiting for the moment to impeach him should he ever propose something like that. What you describe as ""camps"" is much more likely to be diluted into policies like ""teachers are not allowed to discuss trangenderism with students""",2024-11-06 16:59:16,negative,0.6645,0.6645,0.3087,0.0268,r/conservative

Part of that majority is just the same old wealthy conservative power structure that’s always been the slobbering heart of the Republican Party—rich people protecting their wealth.

These are the people who persecuted immigrants—from the Germans, to the Irish, to the Southern Europeans, to the Chinese, to the Japanese, and in and on. In the ‘20s, it was the people who joined the resurgent Ku Klux Klan. In the ‘30s, it was Lindbergh and the American First isolationists. In the ‘50s, it was the McCarthyite anti-communist witch hunters. But right-wing media and social media has turbo-charged these groups and brought the, out in the open. They’ve convinced people too stupid to think for themselves that they are victims, and the people to blame for their failure to succeed are  not the wealthy people controlling society, but the marginalized people trying to make their way in a world stacked against them.

Our brains are wired to prioritize emotions over logic when we’re feeling uncertain or threatened.

For many conservative voters, the GOP is like that well-known road they’ve driven a hundred times. Even if there’s construction, potholes, or signs saying “danger,” the familiarity of the path makes it feel safer than the new route.

"The fact is, the Biden/Harris administration regulated the oil industry into oblivion. Due to the absolutely ridiculous amount of regulation imposed upon these companies, their profit margin absolutely tanked. This was directly displayed by the rise in energy prices after Biden s election in 2020 that the companies imposed on their buyers to make up for the loss in profit. and as a result, a rise in the cost of everyday items. 

It costs money to transport and all of the shit we use up on a daily basis, and that cost of transport is then imposed upon the consumer, which is why we have skyhigh gas prices and even worse sky high food prices across the board.

This election has shown the vast majority of Americans are feeling the everyday suffering that Biden/Harris has imposed on everyone the last 4 years.

And guess what, Kamala didn't do a single fuckin thing to prove she'd be any different than Biden was. So she lost, and lost by an extremely large margin.",2024-11-06 14:27:13,negative,0.9137,0.9137,0.0776,0.0087,r/conservative

"> This was directly displayed by the rise in energy prices after Biden s election in 2020 that the companies imposed on their buyers to make up for the loss in profit. and as a result, a rise in the cost of everyday items.

That isn’t why energy prices rose. They rose because OPEC cut production. And the Biden administration didn’t overregulate it. They got production increased, which is why those prices are back down and have been for several months.

Oil and gas prices aren’t that sensitive to “regulation.” What they’re sensitive to is production and supply. The more oil/gas that’s being produced, both here and abroad, the *lower* the cost (due to ample supply) and thus the lower the profits for oil/gas companies.



> why we have skyhigh gas prices 

Have you seen the price of gas?

> This election has shown the vast majority of Americans are feeling the everyday suffering that Biden/Harris has imposed on everyone the last 4 years.

Sure. “The economy.” The world’s strongest, with far better after-Covid effects than any other Western economy.

> So she lost, and lost by an extremely large margin.

Yeah, I noticed. Even though all the factors you cite are better now than when Trump left office. So it’s pretty clear “the economy” is just the fig leaf people put on their rationalizations for not voting for Harris. It’s not even a very good one, since the evidence is right in front of us. But they don’t care about facts — at which point, I’m repeating myself.",2024-11-06 16:16:10,negative,0.5735,0.5735,0.3577,0.0688,r/conservative

"It's the ""belief"" in the economy and the lies trump repeats over and over and over. Inflation flattened, but prices didn't go down really (obviously) they just stopped inflating as bad. People still are hurting at the grocery store, and Democrats are telling them the economy is great (objectively it is) but wages are still stagnating. Trump is acknowledging the problem (and not that he helped create it) and saying he'll fix it.
