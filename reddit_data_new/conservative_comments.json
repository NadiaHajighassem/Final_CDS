So guess what,  until the owners of those ballots work out the details with the State of Nevada,  the votes will not count.  However  right now, Harris is 60,266  votes behind Trump.  So do the simple math....even if she got all 13K votes,  she would still lose NV  and the popular vote in the state.  Bad enough when you do not get to 270 and still lose the popular vote.  America spoke.  Night over!",

Require every citizen show that ID every time they vote, every time they apply for a government benefit, every time they apply for a job, every time they're stopped by the police, every time they interact with any level of American government or do anything else where proof of citizenship is required or beneficial.

Take all the employees and put them into unused Federal office buildings with no computers, phones, or anything but a chair and four walls.  That's their new work location until they are vetted.  Cut power to all of the (now vacant) FBI, CIA, and DOJ properties, and then use the Texas Rangers to vet those personnel, returning them to work as they are vetted for not being corrupt and/or in the pay of foreign powers.\n\nYou cannot fix the corruption in the bureaucracy in DC with a corrupt DOJ.",

Something changed in me towards the end of these last 4 years when I saw what happened to our country. It got so bad that even I finally had to pay attention. Even I finally was like ‚ÄúOh wait‚Ä¶this all makes me extremely uncomfortable, what the f*ck is even going on.‚Äù Even I finally was like ‚ÄúOkay wait I think I love my country enough that this all has to be stopped‚Äù. My husband and I also started TTC this year and I think having to realistically think about my future children‚Äôs future flipped a switch.

I didn‚Äôt become the least bit political until the last couple of years of Trumps first term. I knew politicians only served their own interests and appreciated that a non political candidate was chosen. I thought we were screwed either way. When the MSM came after him so hard my eyes were opened to the Deep State agenda to fight him tooth and nail and prevent people from appreciating his fight for freedom. He is none of the horrible things so many think about him. He wants what is best for the average American citizen and isn‚Äôt worried about lining his own pockets or those of his friends. \n\nAs Reddit is a very left-leaning platform it is not the best environment to really research all the positive things surrounding Trump and republican views. If you haven‚Äôt looked into Telegram, I would highly recommend it! You can follow many different channels that share news not controlled by leftist ideology. If you, or anyone else needs  help navigating it, feel free to reach out to me there @ArcaneSiren27. Bless you for following your heart and prepare yourself for all the winning and freedom ahead! It is a beautiful day to be an American! üá∫üá∏",

I‚Äôm absolutely mind blown by all the posts & comments I‚Äôm seeing about women terrified, crying, and so anxious about their rights and the rights of their children. He has literally been the president before and what rights did we lose? All he did was allow states to make decisions on abortions, so if that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre upset about, they should be mad at their own state. I‚Äôm in disbelief at the delusional things I‚Äôm seeing.\n\nI had a MC in January and had no problems getting the medical care I needed. I‚Äôm currently expecting a son & daughter. I voted red FOR my kids. I want them to be safe in our country, have rights, and not have to eat poisoned food.",

Abortion should not be a federal mandate. States decide..and each side have gotten a slice of the pie.. pro-lifers have their pro life states and pro choice have their states. \n\n  But these liberal women are the same people who are screaming, \"trans women are women!\" No they fucking aren't! We don't need males in women's sports or bathrooms or locker room or women prisons! \n\nWhat about those women's rights? They are seriously loony tunes!",

They kept insisting they were \"defenders of democracy\" and we pointed out that nobody voted for Harris in anything before last night, but they _also_ oppose putting abortion up for a vote, which is what the repeal of Roe vs. Wade did.  I don't oppose abortion personally, and I hope to see it legalized everywhere DEMOCRATICALLY.",

Since abortion is a service, we don‚Äôt have an unalienable right to abortion, since it‚Äôs predicated on another individual performing that service. \nIt should be a states issue, just as our founding fathers intended. It‚Äôs not a *right* that needs to be protected under federal law.\n\nI voted for Trump, but I also voted for abortion access in my state election. A women‚Äôs right to abortion now lies in a state election, and this likely won‚Äôt be a presidential issue ever again.\n\nTo each their own, but I find it weird that abortion is a voting issue for some people. It feels like an uninformed take. You want to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù your child getting cream pied and their ability to abort the fetus? Lol. It‚Äôs so strange. \n\nMost people will go their whole life without having an abortion. It‚Äôs an issue that won‚Äôt affect the majority of Americans. Yet the economy, taxes, and inflation we feel every. Single. Day. And that‚Äôs not a voting issue for these people!? Go figure.",

        "comment": "I'm a mother with a daughter. I don't believe that women have the right to kill their baby just because the baby is inside of their body. All arguments for abortion fall flat when you really think and apply logic. And calling abortion healthcare is such an abomination.\n\nI genuinely believe substantially less people would be okay with abortion if they were more educated on it. Also, if they had children. I was already not okay with abortion before I had my daughter, but when she was born, I became passionately against it. The idea of destroying the life of a baby is heart-wrenching. I cry when I hear too much about it, and I really never cry over things that aren't extremely grieving.\n\nYou're also totally right about other rights. Sure, they're not specific to women in a lot of cases, like censorship, but also safe women-only spaces, absolutely. I would go nuts if a man was in the bathroom with my little girl. Absolutely nuts. I don't care how mentally unwell you are that you believe with every fiber of your being that you're a woman. Get the hell out.",

        "comment": "Project 2025 and the Democrats scare mongering. \n\nCouple of weeks ago I pointed out on  r/ menopause that Project 2025 was not Trump's platform. Truth. I'm sure I got down voted to heck, but I was so tired of these scare tactics. Then they attacked me bringing up other things unrelated to my post. \n\nIf you believe Project 2025 is what is going to happen (as if all that could happen) then maybe sort of feel like it would be downhill/backwards. But I don't believe it is his platform or that even half of it can be done. Even with having the house and senate, they are unlikely to address all the things in that project especially as it relates to women in 2 years. There are other more important things to address. (2 years being when voting happens again and we could lose the senate or something.) Even if we get all 4, they just aren't going to do everything in that project. \n\nI have not read the project but was able to gather info about it regarding women. \n\nOne BIG concern they have is not being able to get the abortion pills. \n\nPersonally I'm ok with a morning after, but after several weeks it is too hard on a woman's body. They don't want women to know that it isn't like birth control. It's a medical miscarriage and there might be baby parts the further along. How gruesome to see you killed your baby. In a clinic they whisk that away.",

I didn‚Äôt become the least bit political until the last couple of years of Trumps first term. I knew politicians only served their own interests and appreciated that a non political candidate was chosen. I thought we were screwed either way. When the MSM came after him so hard my eyes were opened to the Deep State agenda to fight him tooth and nail and prevent people from appreciating his fight for freedom. He is none of the horrible things so many think about him. He wants what is best for the average American citizen and isn‚Äôt worried about lining his own pockets or those of his friends. \n\nAs Reddit is a very left-leaning platform it is not the best environment to really research all the positive things surrounding Trump and republican views. If you haven‚Äôt looked into Telegram, I would highly recommend it! You can follow many different channels that share news not controlled by leftist ideology. If you, or anyone else needs  help navigating it, feel free to reach out to me there @ArcaneSiren27. Bless you for following your heart and prepare yourself for all the winning and freedom ahead! It is a beautiful day to be an American! üá∫üá∏",

I didn‚Äôt become the least bit political until the last couple of years of Trumps first term. I knew politicians only served their own interests and appreciated that a non political candidate was chosen. I thought we were screwed either way. When the MSM came after him so hard my eyes were opened to the Deep State agenda to fight him tooth and nail and prevent people from appreciating his fight for freedom. He is none of the horrible things so many think about him. He wants what is best for the average American citizen and isn‚Äôt worried about lining his own pockets or those of his friends. \n\nAs Reddit is a very left-leaning platform it is not the best environment to really research all the positive things surrounding Trump and republican views. If you haven‚Äôt looked into Telegram, I would highly recommend it! You can follow many different channels that share news not controlled by leftist ideology. If you, or anyone else needs  help navigating it, feel free to reach out to me there @ArcaneSiren27. Bless you for following your heart and prepare yourself for all the winning and freedom ahead!

I didn‚Äôt become the least bit political until the last couple of years of Trumps first term. I knew politicians only served their own interests and appreciated that a non political candidate was chosen. I thought we were screwed either way. When the MSM came after him so hard my eyes were opened to the Deep State agenda to fight him tooth and nail and prevent people from appreciating his fight for freedom. He is none of the horrible things so many think about him. He wants what is best for the average American citizen and isn‚Äôt worried about lining his own pockets or those of his friends. \n\nAs Reddit is a very left-leaning platform it is not the best environment to really research all the positive things surrounding Trump and republican views. If you haven‚Äôt looked into Telegram, I would highly recommend it! You can follow many different channels that share news not controlled by leftist ideology. If you, or anyone else needs  help navigating it, feel free to reach out to me there @ArcaneSiren27. Bless you for following your heart and prepare yourself for all the winning and freedom ahead! It is a beautiful day to be an American! üá∫üá∏",

Please be respectful. Remember all the FJB stickers. All the Brandon memes. Parading around MAGA flags, proud boys and anti Biden stuff.

Trump nailed it at his rallies when asking if people were better off 4 years ago than now. It is hard to say no to that question unless you‚Äôre in the 1%.",

Easy to see why Trump won when you look at all the factors. \n\n* Mass immigration problem, yk the one Trump said was going to happen \n* Rising prices for everything, buying groceries to properties\n* Kamala only seemed to target women and LGBT people, leaving a lot of young guys feeling disconnected. As a younger guy, I honestly feel she gave me no reason to vote for her, this is in addition to wanting to continue to support wars. I wouldn't go die for this lady or her administration if it came down to it. \n* She became a main candidate without anyone wanting her after Biden dropped out and failed to distinguish herself from him.\n* Kamala suggested taxing capital gains which is a horrible idea, considering investors are the ones who not only stir the economy but also help create jobs.",

At the end of the day, Kamala supporters and the Democrats are Americans and despite how much we differ in our political beliefs, we all have one thing in common: we all want what's best for our country and the human race which is why we should respect the political beliefs of those that don't agree with ours as long as they do the same.",

Despite the fact that so many radical liberals vocalize hate, admonished conservatives who peacefully challenged their world views, called us uneducated racist Nazis, showed no mercy about wishing death on those of us who were skeptic of government vax mandates, made life unaffordable, and admonished anyone who dared to question child mutilation and the circus of gender craziness, (and did so under a banner of calling themselves the party of diversity and acceptance?!), our best response is a complete departure from that same behavior. I will forgive. I know all of us Americans are more the same than we are different. I have definitely fallen short of this reaction in the last 12 hours and I will do better. MAGA",

(I‚Äôd also like to point out I think Kamala was a horrible choice 4 years ago when Biden picked her and that didn‚Äôt get any better when the DNC pushed her on us.) Anyways‚Ä¶ I think he‚Äôs the weed that helped started the deep divide in our country and only fed the flame. But with that said I don‚Äôt think there will be camps, baby factories, etc. I don‚Äôt think it will be as hellish as the far left screams just as I don‚Äôt think the past 4 years were as bad as the far right claimed it to be. \n\nBut at the end of the day I do agree with OP. Please be respectful. Remember all the FJB stickers. All the Brandon memes. Parading around MAGA flags, proud boys and anti Biden stuff. I know most republicans didn‚Äôt do that and only the cultist minority did. Remember that most democrats and/or liberals will wake up today, sigh at the loss and go to work.",

I think centrist, libertarians, swing voters and even some democrats voted against her because of money. At the end of the day most voters care about what‚Äôs in their checking account after getting their check and paying bills. Trump nailed it at his rallies when asking if people were better off 4 years ago than now. It is hard to say no to that question unless you‚Äôre in the 1%.",

Easy to see why Trump won when you look at all the factors. \n\n* Mass immigration problem, yk the one Trump said was going to happen \n* Rising prices for everything, buying groceries to properties\n* Kamala only seemed to target women and LGBT people, leaving a lot of young guys feeling disconnected. As a younger guy, I honestly feel she gave me no reason to vote for her, this is in addition to wanting to continue to support wars. I wouldn't go die for this lady or her administration if it came down to it. \n* She became a main candidate without anyone wanting her after Biden dropped out and failed to distinguish herself from him.\n* Kamala suggested taxing capital gains which is a horrible idea, considering investors are the ones who not only stir the economy but also help create jobs.",

As a younger guy, I honestly feel she gave me no reason to vote for her, this is in addition to wanting to continue to support wars. I wouldn't go die for this lady or her administration if it came down to it. \n* She became a main candidate without anyone wanting her after Biden dropped out and failed to distinguish herself from him.\n* Kamala suggested taxing capital gains which is a horrible idea, considering investors are the ones who not only stir the economy but also help create jobs.",

This means at least 1 of every 2 people you talk to is seeking to create foreign influence.  \n\nSharing viewpoints isn‚Äôt bad, but they need to clean their own horse before they point at our dirty kitchen.\n\nWe need to talk and share ideas but think where it‚Äôs coming from and what their motives are.  \n\nAlso, don‚Äôt be a poor winner.  We need to come together now, Americans first parties second!",

        "comment": "Waiting to see all the leftist gun groups stage the civil disobedience they've been projecting onto the right. Anyone remember the race riots a few years back with BLM? Imagine that but a decent few of them have been 'training'. \n\nBeing real, if it were an actual 2A red blooded American on top of that building, we wouldn't have missed.... the first shot.\nNot making light of what happened, but expect a lot of shots with very little efficiency. This is what you should be worried about up until around inauguration.\n\nFurthermore we still have a few months until he's sworn in. They could make Biden senile and reseat him with the VP... making Kamala Potus with or without an election win. A few certain Exec Orders and boom you have Martial Law, extension of Presidential powers and an indefinite postponement of election results. \nWhich gets those FEMA camps filled and the country in the direction it has been. \n\nTLDR: everyone celebrating but we forget about the fact that this person still has a position of power, has already shoehorned her way past her own DNC election and likely has no concern over the actions herein. In fact it only informs them of who their enemies are. Intel scouting. \n#tinfoilhat",

It must suck to be that weak and brainwashed. \n\n I don't LOVE Trump, but voted for him without hesitation because I'm conservative and his policies align with my beliefs more than the other choice, and I feel like he really does love this country and wants to see it prosper.",

I‚Äôve seen people who took their sobriety seriously relapse due to loved ones dying or losing their jobs or homes. For example, there was a mother who was clean for 20 plus years and unfortunately her daughter who rarely used drugs overdosed on a fake Xanax (laced with fentanyl). Her daughter was only 17 when she died. That poor lady wanted to end her life by taking a hot shot and it took her everything in her power to not do that. I‚Äôm sorry if you relapse because of a political election then you probably didn‚Äôt want to get clean in the first place, that or you just want attention. I‚Äôm trying so hard to just stay quiet because I don‚Äôt want to get banned.",

He actually mentioned this policy plan before Kamala, ANNNNND rvw is a Supreme Court issue. The president can try to push the issue but they don‚Äôt make the decision... Trump‚Äôs stance on abortion is that it should be elective up to 24 weeks, with the exception of life threatening circumstances. I know people aren‚Äôt going to receive this comment well so I‚Äôm just going to stop there.\n(ALSO, I have struggled with infertility for over 4 years with multiple losses and no LC.

If your child has developmental issues or delays or an extra chromosome, that doesn‚Äôt mean something is ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù Grow the fu!k up and learn that babies born with special needs are human beings. They still deserve life. \n\nLife won‚Äôt be easy, but no one‚Äôs life - regardless of your ailments, ability or what have you upon birth - is ever promised to be easy. \n\nThey could easily be talking about the health of the mother too, which I realize that, but as a sister of someone with special needs that post really pissed me off this morning.",

If his ideas will benefit the people of this great nation then I hope he succeeds for the good of America.

I'm tired of the division, the lying, and the way our nation has been destroyed by the Left's political movements - Bee Elle Em and De fund the police - and see the horrible consequences of both every single day in my city. There's no way I would've voted for someone so inept and incompetent, and who only got where she is bc of gender and race (and sleeping her way to the top).\n\nI also couldn't vote for someone whose name literally means \"horrible\" in Finnish. Oh, and the cackling didn't help.\n\nI voted for Trump bc:\n\n1 He cares about the USA border, will deport the bad people who've snuck across,  and will start securing it - again.\n\n2 He will protect women's spaces, the safety of Jewish students on college campuses, and the rights of Asian American college students who have been kept out of universities due to racism by bigoted policies.\n\n3 He will stand up to Islamic terrorism and help protect Israel.\n\nI did not vote for Kamala bc:\n\n1 She cared only about the borders of other countries, would continue to ignore criminals sneaking into the USA to committ crimes, and would make it easier than ever for anyone to illegally enter the USA.\n\n2 She would kowtow to men who insist on invading women's spaces, continue to ignore the safety of Jewish students at US college campuses, and ignore the decades of racial discrimination against Asians at US Universities.\n\n3 She would pretend Islamic terrorists are trustworthy and undermine the safety of Israel by pushing them to make a peace agreement with shose who want to push Israel and Jews into the sea.\n\nToday is a wonderful day and it will only get better.",

There will be a shift in media. 25 million views on JRE proves there is more value to most Americans in independent interviews than daily fear mongering in MSM.",

Lol I‚Äôm not American, but it‚Äôs so good to see the sanctimonious, uppity libtards crying. \n\nAnd women‚Äôs rights don‚Äôt mean just abortion rights(which i personally fully support as a pro-choice woman), it means their safety in bathrooms, their dignity in changing rooms, their sweat and blood in sports they have trained from childhood. It means not mutilating children to fit gender agendas instead of treating make believe as just that.\n\nAnd hopefully they will learn a lesson that calling people who have a different opinion evil and trying to punish them for exercising their freedom of speech and expression and calling the other party fascists, when it‚Äôs them who are the fascists.",

WE ARE NOT THE MINORTY WE ARE THE MAJORITY AND WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE. tonight will be the night the people took back their country. Trump winning presidency is just one, but extremely crucial, battle that we as americans will continue to fight to make america great again. i am so proud of this country tonight. my faith in this nation and its people are restored.",

        "comment": "Donald Trump might pull this off. It‚Äôs too early to say; we might not know till the middle of next year, or whenever some¬†[antediluvian state finishes counting by hand](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-presidential-election-2024-when-dates-candidates-voting/). Plus Electoral College madness means that Trump could surge in the popular vote yet still lose via Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (the reverse Hillary). But consider the following:\n\nFirst, he took¬†[Florida easily, including Miami-Dade](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-election-latest-news-polling-trump-kamala/). Joe Biden won that county in 2020; Hillary Clinton swept it by nearly 30 points in 2016. What‚Äôs made the difference? Trump‚Äôs doing well among Latino voters, presumably men.\n\nSecond, there are hints he‚Äôs gained ground among the affluent in Virginia, which is supposed to be a lock for Kamala; Wasps with degrees are her people.\n\nThird, he seems to be scooping Georgia, which might have been competitive and certainly suggests the sun-belt is safe (Texas is also not in play). Fourth, an NBC exit poll gives him a six point advantage among independents in the critical state of Pennsylvania.\n\nExit polls generally indicate that¬†[‚Äúthe future of democracy‚Äù is a leading issue,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/americans-voting-out-of-resentment-and-fear/)¬†which breathless TV commentators assumed was a good sign for Harris. But lots of Republicans think the Democrats stole the election in 2020, so they might be recording concern for that issue as well.\n\nThe other major matter is the economy, and Trump polls stronger than Kamala on that one for obvious reasons (ie inflation). No wonder election betting seems to slightly favour Republicans, along with the¬†*New York Times*¬†and Decision Desk HQ.\n\nBut, yes, there‚Äôs a long night ahead, and none of us knows anything for sure. It‚Äôs a delight to watch British TV presenters disclose the latest thing they read on CNN as if it were a personal insight (‚ÄùI‚Äôm predicting now that Harris will take Vermont and the Pope will carry the Vatican‚Äù).\n\nBut what we can decisively say at this juncture is that of the four options ‚Äì Trump easy win, narrow win; Harris narrow win, easy win ‚Äì the Harris easy win is off the table. Despite January 6, a rape trial, ‚Äúeating the pets‚Äù and a comedian calling Puerto Rico a ‚Äúfloating island of garbage‚Äù. I wonder if Joe Biden might have done better?\n\n**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/its-beginning-to-look-like-donald-trump-is-going-to-win/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/its-beginning-to-look-like-donald-trump-is-going-to-win/)",

I think if you click on each state you can see what the % the vote count is at. A news broadcast like NBC will be more cautious before calling based on the overall percentage of votes or rural vs urban centres. For example, in 2020, Arizona was erroneously called by some networks which was too close and too early to call.",

That has become \"normal\" for millions, including myself. A lot of people were manipulated into feeling ashamed for supporting Trump 8 years ago.\n\nI'm happy that the conversation was eventually had with OP and Dad.\n\nWe can't let the mainstream media dictate our conversations with FAMILY!!! Or for that matter.... friends and family, or anyone else.\n\nIt's a Liberal tactic to scare people into not using their 1st amendment rights!\n\nAs a 40 year old, I bought my MAGA hat 9 months ago. I was initially afraid to wear it in my incredibly liberal state. I was afraid to wear a fucking hat! Eventually,  I said fuck this. I'm not going to be silenced. Oddly enough, the response by people was far more positive than negative.",

That has become \"normal\" for millions, including myself. A lot of people were manipulated into feeling ashamed for supporting Trump 8 years ago.\n\nI'm happy that the conversation was eventually had with OP and Dad.\n\nWe can't let the mainstream media dictate our conversations with FAMILY!!! Or for that matter.... friends and family, or anyone else.\n\nIt's a Liberal tactic to scare people into not using their 1st amendment rights!\n\nAs a 40 year old, I bought my MAGA hat 9 months ago. I was initially afraid to wear it in my incredibly liberal state. I was afraid to wear a fucking hat! Eventually,  I said fuck this. I'm not going to be silenced. Oddly enough, the response by people was far more positive than negative.",
