So guess what,  until the owners of those ballots work out the details with the State of Nevada,  the votes will not count.  However  right now, Harris is 60,266  votes behind Trump.  So do the simple math....even if she got all 13K votes,  she would still lose NV  and the popular vote in the state.  Bad enough when you do not get to 270 and still lose the popular vote.  America spoke.  Night over!",

It looked dated in every way, especially celebrity endorsements.\n\n They just don't get it, the days of being lectured to by the  billionaire Hollywood set who have flown in on private jets after leaving a diddy party to tell us all to be better people is over.\n\nEven the Obamas themselves, once the great political stars, looked like angry rich people who couldn't understand why normal people didn't think like them & their friends in Martha's Vinyard",

I’ve loved most of what John Favreau has done but I’ll have a hard time watching anything he is involved in. Sometimes we just have to take a stand.",

Require every citizen show that ID every time they vote, every time they apply for a government benefit, every time they apply for a job, every time they're stopped by the police, every time they interact with any level of American government or do anything else where proof of citizenship is required or beneficial.

Take all the employees and put them into unused Federal office buildings with no computers, phones, or anything but a chair and four walls.  That's their new work location until they are vetted.  Cut power to all of the (now vacant) FBI, CIA, and DOJ properties, and then use the Texas Rangers to vet those personnel, returning them to work as they are vetted for not being corrupt and/or in the pay of foreign powers.\n\nYou cannot fix the corruption in the bureaucracy in DC with a corrupt DOJ.",

First of all, on abortion, Harris wouldn’t have been able to do anything because Roe v. Wade was overturned. So this was an empty promise. But the issue somehow spiraled into this vague doomsday language where you had people like Michelle Obama and Oprah talking about how Trump wants to take away women’s right to vote?? Ffs. I’m so glad enough voters saw through the bullshit.",

I always thought I was either democrat or liberal but also didn’t really care and thought everyone was crap and thought our country was just whatever. Something changed in me towards the end of these last 4 years when I saw what happened to our country. It got so bad that even I finally had to pay attention. Even I finally was like “Oh wait…this all makes me extremely uncomfortable, what the f*ck is even going on.” Even I finally was like “Okay wait I think I love my country enough that this all has to be stopped”. My husband and I also started TTC this year and I think having to realistically think about my future children’s future flipped a switch. I am SO proud to say that I, a WOMAN, VOTED RED, for me, for all women, and for my future children!!!",

I didn’t become the least bit political until the last couple of years of Trumps first term. I knew politicians only served their own interests and appreciated that a non political candidate was chosen. I thought we were screwed either way. When the MSM came after him so hard my eyes were opened to the Deep State agenda to fight him tooth and nail and prevent people from appreciating his fight for freedom. He is none of the horrible things so many think about him. He wants what is best for the average American citizen and isn’t worried about lining his own pockets or those of his friends. \n\nAs Reddit is a very left-leaning platform it is not the best environment to really research all the positive things surrounding Trump and republican views. If you haven’t looked into Telegram, I would highly recommend it! You can follow many different channels that share news not controlled by leftist ideology. If you, or anyone else needs  help navigating it, feel free to reach out to me there @ArcaneSiren27. Bless you for following your heart and prepare yourself for all the winning and freedom ahead! It is a beautiful day to be an American! 🇺🇸",

        "comment": "100% agreed!👏🏽\n\nUnfortunately abortion is not a right, it’s a privilege. Since abortion is a service, we don’t have an unalienable right to abortion, since it’s predicated on another individual performing that service. \nIt should be a states issue, just as our founding fathers intended. It’s not a *right* that needs to be protected under federal law.\n\nI voted for Trump, but I also voted for abortion access in my state election. A women’s right to abortion now lies in a state election, and this likely won’t be a presidential issue ever again.\n\nTo each their own, but I find it weird that abortion is a voting issue for some people. It feels like an uninformed take. You want to “protect” your child getting cream pied and their ability to abort the fetus? Lol. It’s so strange. \n\nMost people will go their whole life without having an abortion. It’s an issue that won’t affect the majority of Americans. Yet the economy, taxes, and inflation we feel every. Single. Day. And that’s not a voting issue for these people!? Go figure.",

        "comment": "I'm a mother with a daughter. I don't believe that women have the right to kill their baby just because the baby is inside of their body. All arguments for abortion fall flat when you really think and apply logic. And calling abortion healthcare is such an abomination.\n\nI genuinely believe substantially less people would be okay with abortion if they were more educated on it. Also, if they had children. I was already not okay with abortion before I had my daughter, but when she was born, I became passionately against it. The idea of destroying the life of a baby is heart-wrenching. I cry when I hear too much about it, and I really never cry over things that aren't extremely grieving.\n\nYou're also totally right about other rights. Sure, they're not specific to women in a lot of cases, like censorship, but also safe women-only spaces, absolutely. I would go nuts if a man was in the bathroom with my little girl. Absolutely nuts. I don't care how mentally unwell you are that you believe with every fiber of your being that you're a woman. Get the hell out.",

I'm sure I got down voted to heck, but I was so tired of these scare tactics. Then they attacked me bringing up other things unrelated to my post. \n\nIf you believe Project 2025 is what is going to happen (as if all that could happen) then maybe sort of feel like it would be downhill/backwards. But I don't believe it is his platform or that even half of it can be done. Even with having the house and senate, they are unlikely to address all the things in that project especially as it relates to women in 2 years. There are other more important things to address. (2 years being when voting happens again and we could lose the senate or something.) Even if we get all 4, they just aren't going to do everything in that project. \n\nI have not read the project but was able to gather info about it regarding women. \n\nOne BIG concern they have is not being able to get the abortion pills. \n\nPersonally I'm ok with a morning after, but after several weeks it is too hard on a woman's body. They don't want women to know that it isn't like birth control. It's a medical miscarriage and there might be baby parts the further along. How gruesome to see you killed your baby. In a clinic they whisk that away.",

I'd like to go into it. \n\n>Her right to free speech\n\nHow was free speech at risk by either party? \n\n>her right to assemble, to protest\n\nOnce again... Huh? \n\n>her right to exist as a female in exclusively female spaces like sports and restrooms\n\nY'know... Fair enough. \n\n>to bear arms\n\nAs long as SCOTUS remains how it is the 2nd amendment is well protected. Saying that I understand your point there. \n\n>her right to not have gender confusion or mutilation pushed onto her\n\nNo one was trying to do that. \n\n>her right to be educated and raised by her parents and not the government\n\nFun fact! Homeschooled kids actually tend to do better in college. So yeah. Full support. \n\n>Most importantly her right to be an innocent child. \n\nThat's more an internet problem than a government problem.",

I’m a woman and I have 2 daughters and I could never vote for someone who wants to force them against their will to be boys or allowing MEN in our female bathrooms or giving MEN free feminine products when I’ve had to pay their pink tax for ages. Standing up for women is voting for Trump! \n\nAlso, I feel like abortion isn’t even a real issue for dems because what’s the point of forcing kids to be the opposite gender and injecting fake history and news in their brains if they just wanted to abort them all anyway?? It’s so hypocritical. Biden could’ve done something related to abortion, and he didn’t. Kamala was VP and she did nothing either. 🤷‍♀️\n\n(If my kids decide they want to not be girls, that’s something they can decide as adults, not children!)",

I didn’t become the least bit political until the last couple of years of Trumps first term. I knew politicians only served their own interests and appreciated that a non political candidate was chosen. I thought we were screwed either way. When the MSM came after him so hard my eyes were opened to the Deep State agenda to fight him tooth and nail and prevent people from appreciating his fight for freedom. He is none of the horrible things so many think about him. He wants what is best for the average American citizen and isn’t worried about lining his own pockets or those of his friends. \n\nAs Reddit is a very left-leaning platform it is not the best environment to really research all the positive things surrounding Trump and republican views. If you haven’t looked into Telegram, I would highly recommend it! You can follow many different channels that share news not controlled by leftist ideology. If you, or anyone else needs  help navigating it, feel free to reach out to me there @ArcaneSiren27. Bless you for following your heart and prepare yourself for all the winning and freedom ahead! It is a beautiful day to be an American! 🇺🇸",

Losing Tulsi was a really bad move that hurt the Democrats a great deal. Far more than they are willing to admit.",

I didn’t become the least bit political until the last couple of years of Trumps first term. I knew politicians only served their own interests and appreciated that a non political candidate was chosen. I thought we were screwed either way. When the MSM came after him so hard my eyes were opened to the Deep State agenda to fight him tooth and nail and prevent people from appreciating his fight for freedom. He is none of the horrible things so many think about him. He wants what is best for the average American citizen and isn’t worried about lining his own pockets or those of his friends. \n\nAs Reddit is a very left-leaning platform it is not the best environment to really research all the positive things surrounding Trump and republican views. If you haven’t looked into Telegram, I would highly recommend it! You can follow many different channels that share news not controlled by leftist ideology. If you, or anyone else needs  help navigating it, feel free to reach out to me there @ArcaneSiren27. Bless you for following your heart and prepare yourself for all the winning and freedom ahead! It is a beautiful day to be an American! 🇺🇸",

        "comment": "You have every right to be proud of your mental fortitude, openness, and willingness to stand in the middle of the aisle and see what side offered you the best opportunity to succeed, not only now but in the future. I didn’t become the least bit political until the last couple of years of Trumps first term. I knew politicians only served their own interests and appreciated that a non political candidate was chosen. I thought we were screwed either way. When the MSM came after him so hard my eyes were opened to the Deep State agenda to fight him tooth and nail and prevent people from appreciating his fight for freedom. He is none of the horrible things so many think about him. He wants what is best for the average American citizen and isn’t worried about lining his own pockets or those of his friends. \n\nAs Reddit is a very left-leaning platform it is not the best environment to really research all the positive things surrounding Trump and republican views. If you haven’t looked into Telegram, I would highly recommend it! You can follow many different channels that share news not controlled by leftist ideology. If you, or anyone else needs  help navigating it, feel free to reach out to me there @ArcaneSiren27. Bless you for following your heart and prepare yourself for all the winning and freedom ahead! It is a beautiful day to be an American! 🇺🇸",

She should have been propped up and promoted as the new face of the Democrat Party.\n\nInstead, Democrats drummed Tulsi out of office and then kicked her out of the party. That's on them. Losing Tulsi was a really bad move that hurt the Democrats a great deal. Far more than they are willing to admit.",

They have been so brainwashed into hating that man, that they would rather see him fail all of us, than hope he does well as president. \n\nWe need unity in this country, but I don’t think we well ever truly see it again.\n\nStay safe out there OP, and thank you for your service.",

Anyways… I think he’s the weed that helped started the deep divide in our country and only fed the flame. But with that said I don’t think there will be camps, baby factories, etc. I don’t think it will be as hellish as the far left screams just as I don’t think the past 4 years were as bad as the far right claimed it to be. \n\nBut at the end of the day I do agree with OP. Please be respectful. Remember all the FJB stickers. All the Brandon memes. Parading around MAGA flags, proud boys and anti Biden stuff. I know most republicans didn’t do that and only the cultist minority did. Remember that most democrats and/or liberals will wake up today, sigh at the loss and go to work.",

I think centrist, libertarians, swing voters and even some democrats voted against her because of money. At the end of the day most voters care about what’s in their checking account after getting their check and paying bills. Trump nailed it at his rallies when asking if people were better off 4 years ago than now. It is hard to say no to that question unless you’re in the 1%.",

Easy to see why Trump won when you look at all the factors. \n\n* Mass immigration problem, yk the one Trump said was going to happen \n* Rising prices for everything, buying groceries to properties\n* Kamala only seemed to target women and LGBT people, leaving a lot of young guys feeling disconnected. As a younger guy, I honestly feel she gave me no reason to vote for her, this is in addition to wanting to continue to support wars. I wouldn't go die for this lady or her administration if it came down to it. \n* She became a main candidate without anyone wanting her after Biden dropped out and failed to distinguish herself from him.\n* Kamala suggested taxing capital gains which is a horrible idea, considering investors are the ones who not only stir the economy but also help create jobs.",

This \"get along\" attitude started when those limpdicks started getting up to the Joint Chiefs positions. The military's job is to kill people and break things.\n\nSorry bud, I'm done trying to negotiate with traitors. When I took that oath it MEANT something. When I take the oath every year for my current position, it MEANS something to me. The current liberal movement is the \"domestic\" portion of \"against all enemies, foreign and domestic\".

Even the suicide hotline and the r/SuicideWatch sub are being bombarded by liberals or Kamala supporters and I feel very empathetic towards them I hope no liberal or Kamala supporter actually kills themselves over Trump winning and we should be praying for those who are having those thoughts. At the end of the day, Kamala supporters and the Democrats are Americans and despite how much we differ in our political beliefs, we all have one thing in common: we all want what's best for our country and the human race which is why we should respect the political beliefs of those that don't agree with ours as long as they do the same.",

        "comment": "Thank you for this, and for your service. Now more than ever I needed this reminder. Despite the fact that so many radical liberals vocalize hate, admonished conservatives who peacefully challenged their world views, called us uneducated racist Nazis, showed no mercy about wishing death on those of us who were skeptic of government vax mandates, made life unaffordable, and admonished anyone who dared to question child mutilation and the circus of gender craziness, (and did so under a banner of calling themselves the party of diversity and acceptance?!), our best response is a complete departure from that same behavior. I will forgive. I know all of us Americans are more the same than we are different. I have definitely fallen short of this reaction in the last 12 hours and I will do better. MAGA",

(I’d also like to point out I think Kamala was a horrible choice 4 years ago when Biden picked her and that didn’t get any better when the DNC pushed her on us.) Anyways… I think he’s the weed that helped started the deep divide in our country and only fed the flame. But with that said I don’t think there will be camps, baby factories, etc. I don’t think it will be as hellish as the far left screams just as I don’t think the past 4 years were as bad as the far right claimed it to be. \n\nBut at the end of the day I do agree with OP. Please be respectful. Remember all the FJB stickers. All the Brandon memes. Parading around MAGA flags, proud boys and anti Biden stuff. I know most republicans didn’t do that and only the cultist minority did. Remember that most democrats and/or liberals will wake up today, sigh at the loss and go to work.",

Trump nailed it at his rallies when asking if people were better off 4 years ago than now. It is hard to say no to that question unless you’re in the 1%.",

Easy to see why Trump won when you look at all the factors. \n\n* Mass immigration problem, yk the one Trump said was going to happen \n* Rising prices for everything, buying groceries to properties\n* Kamala only seemed to target women and LGBT people, leaving a lot of young guys feeling disconnected. As a younger guy, I honestly feel she gave me no reason to vote for her, this is in addition to wanting to continue to support wars. I wouldn't go die for this lady or her administration if it came down to it. \n* She became a main candidate without anyone wanting her after Biden dropped out and failed to distinguish herself from him.\n* Kamala suggested taxing capital gains which is a horrible idea, considering investors are the ones who not only stir the economy but also help create jobs.",

He *still* beat them this badly and won even the popular vote. Imagine if next time we run a more likable candidate and Dems are still acting this same way. It'll be more like a Reagan-Mondale landslide. They'd be cooked.",

Easy to see why Trump won when you look at all the factors. \n\n* Mass immigration problem, yk the one Trump said was going to happen \n* Rising prices for everything, buying groceries to properties\n* Kamala only seemed to target women and LGBT people, leaving a lot of young guys feeling disconnected. As a younger guy, I honestly feel she gave me no reason to vote for her, this is in addition to wanting to continue to support wars. I wouldn't go die for this lady or her administration if it came down to it. \n* She became a main candidate without anyone wanting her after Biden dropped out and failed to distinguish herself from him.\n* Kamala suggested taxing capital gains which is a horrible idea, considering investors are the ones who not only stir the economy but also help create jobs.",

The mainstream media wouldn’t call this for another three hours and then they credited Wisconsin. But I love that rural voters pushed it over!!! They should get full credit. I don’t know if that is a narrative that is being purposefully avoided? Maybe because campaigning in a rural area is virtually impossible. But I love rural America so let’s give them credit where credit is due.",

Imagine that but a decent few of them have been 'training'. \n\nBeing real, if it were an actual 2A red blooded American on top of that building, we wouldn't have missed.... the first shot.\nNot making light of what happened, but expect a lot of shots with very little efficiency. This is what you should be worried about up until around inauguration.\n\nFurthermore we still have a few months until he's sworn in. They could make Biden senile and reseat him with the VP... making Kamala Potus with or without an election win. A few certain Exec Orders and boom you have Martial Law, extension of Presidential powers and an indefinite postponement of election results. \nWhich gets those FEMA camps filled and the country in the direction it has been. \n\nTLDR: everyone celebrating but we forget about the fact that this person still has a position of power, has already shoehorned her way past her own DNC election and likely has no concern over the actions herein. In fact it only informs them of who their enemies are. Intel scouting. \n#tinfoilhat",

        "comment": "I’m part of a NA sub and I just saw a post “idk how I’m going to stay sober now that Trump has won.”  🙄🙄🙄 thankfully no one was feeding into their bs. “Waaah Trump made me relapse.” I’d love to see someone say that in an actual meeting and watch other peoples reactions. I’ve seen people who took their sobriety seriously relapse due to loved ones dying or losing their jobs or homes. For example, there was a mother who was clean for 20 plus years and unfortunately her daughter who rarely used drugs overdosed on a fake Xanax (laced with fentanyl). Her daughter was only 17 when she died. That poor lady wanted to end her life by taking a hot shot and it took her everything in her power to not do that. I’m sorry if you relapse because of a political election then you probably didn’t want to get clean in the first place, that or you just want attention. I’m trying so hard to just stay quiet because I don’t want to get banned.",

This is absolutely hilarious and ridiculous at the same time.\n\nFor anyone interested in the comment that got me permabanned:\n“You know Trump wants to force ALL healthcare providers to offer IVF coverage? He actually mentioned this policy plan before Kamala, ANNNNND rvw is a Supreme Court issue. The president can try to push the issue but they don’t make the decision... Trump’s stance on abortion is that it should be elective up to 24 weeks, with the exception of life threatening circumstances. I know people aren’t going to receive this comment well so I’m just going to stop there.\n(ALSO, I have struggled with infertility for over 4 years with multiple losses and no LC. So this IS a concern for me.)”",

If your child has developmental issues or delays or an extra chromosome, that doesn’t mean something is “wrong.” Grow the fu!k up and learn that babies born with special needs are human beings. They still deserve life. \n\nLife won’t be easy, but no one’s life - regardless of your ailments, ability or what have you upon birth - is ever promised to be easy. \n\nThey could easily be talking about the health of the mother too, which I realize that, but as a sister of someone with special needs that post really pissed me off this morning.",

And we’re not allowed to be happy and joyful (Where have I heard that before?) and we should have empathy yadda yadda yadda. I was thrown out of a Telegram Group because I was happy and joyful and didn’t “read” the room! If they had prevailed they would have been screaming all over and then some. I am beyond happy Trump won and it looks like we will control BOTH houses. And one other point. Some idiot on Tik Tok was screaming and crying about the Electoral College and we should do away with it. Ummmmm even if we had he still won the..Wait for it..Popular Vote which they were bitching about the last time.",

They really gave her a 50% chance to win when she had like what a 9% favorability rating in the democratic caucuses in 2020?

At the end of the day, this is a politician who rather than make any important speeches would rather make TikTok’s to Charli. We need professionalism, policy, and not relying on the teenagers. The brat summer that was popular among young voters but more popular among people who are not of age to vote. Her campaign didn’t reach out to the elderly, or gen X. Just Gen Z which a good chunk of that generation is under age.",

And when Nazis were in court, they used her planned parenthood book as an excuse and some of them got off. They also used to give out Margaret Sanger awards, and Hillary Clinton received one. And they fight for this. ",

Trump up 4% with 92% reported voting. Again, a pretty obvious call… or Nevada where Trump is up 5% with 81% reported. \n\nCompletely petty.

I'm tired of the division, the lying, and the way our nation has been destroyed by the Left's political movements - Bee Elle Em and De fund the police - and see the horrible consequences of both every single day in my city. There's no way I would've voted for someone so inept and incompetent, and who only got where she is bc of gender and race (and sleeping her way to the top).\n\nI also couldn't vote for someone whose name literally means \"horrible\" in Finnish. Oh, and the cackling didn't help.\n\nI voted for Trump bc:\n\n1 He cares about the USA border, will deport the bad people who've snuck across,  and will start securing it - again.\n\n2 He will protect women's spaces, the safety of Jewish students on college campuses, and the rights of Asian American college students who have been kept out of universities due to racism by bigoted policies.\n\n3 He will stand up to Islamic terrorism and help protect Israel.\n\nI did not vote for Kamala bc:\n\n1 She cared only about the borders of other countries, would continue to ignore criminals sneaking into the USA to committ crimes, and would make it easier than ever for anyone to illegally enter the USA.\n\n2 She would kowtow to men who insist on invading women's spaces, continue to ignore the safety of Jewish students at US college campuses, and ignore the decades of racial discrimination against Asians at US Universities.\n\n3 She would pretend Islamic terrorists are trustworthy and undermine the safety of Israel by pushing them to make a peace agreement with shose who want to push Israel and Jews into the sea.\n\nToday is a wonderful day and it will only get better.",

        "comment": "Yes 😊  i think something not mentioned enough is that the election shows that MSM is the real loser! The majority of USA citizens are the winners. Mainstream media no longer has a grip on people like it once did. The biases are seen through by most Americans, and we successfully sent that message! There will be a shift in media. 25 million views on JRE proves there is more value to most Americans in independent interviews than daily fear mongering in MSM.",

Lol I’m not American, but it’s so good to see the sanctimonious, uppity libtards crying. \n\nAnd women’s rights don’t mean just abortion rights(which i personally fully support as a pro-choice woman), it means their safety in bathrooms, their dignity in changing rooms, their sweat and blood in sports they have trained from childhood. It means not mutilating children to fit gender agendas instead of treating make believe as just that.\n\nAnd hopefully they will learn a lesson that calling people who have a different opinion evil and trying to punish them for exercising their freedom of speech and expression and calling the other party fascists, when it’s them who are the fascists.",

WE ARE NOT THE MINORTY WE ARE THE MAJORITY AND WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE. tonight will be the night the people took back their country.

        "comment": "Donald Trump might pull this off. It’s too early to say; we might not know till the middle of next year, or whenever some [antediluvian state finishes counting by hand](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-presidential-election-2024-when-dates-candidates-voting/). Plus Electoral College madness means that Trump could surge in the popular vote yet still lose via Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (the reverse Hillary). But consider the following:\n\nFirst, he took [Florida easily, including Miami-Dade](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-election-latest-news-polling-trump-kamala/). Joe Biden won that county in 2020; Hillary Clinton swept it by nearly 30 points in 2016. What’s made the difference? Trump’s doing well among Latino voters, presumably men.\n\nSecond, there are hints he’s gained ground among the affluent in Virginia, which is supposed to be a lock for Kamala; Wasps with degrees are her people.\n\nThird, he seems to be scooping Georgia, which might have been competitive and certainly suggests the sun-belt is safe (Texas is also not in play). Fourth, an NBC exit poll gives him a six point advantage among independents in the critical state of Pennsylvania.\n\nExit polls generally indicate that [“the future of democracy” is a leading issue,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/americans-voting-out-of-resentment-and-fear/) which breathless TV commentators assumed was a good sign for Harris. But lots of Republicans think the Democrats stole the election in 2020, so they might be recording concern for that issue as well.\n\nThe other major matter is the economy, and Trump polls stronger than Kamala on that one for obvious reasons (ie inflation). No wonder election betting seems to slightly favour Republicans, along with the *New York Times* and Decision Desk HQ.\n\nBut, yes, there’s a long night ahead, and none of us knows anything for sure. It’s a delight to watch British TV presenters disclose the latest thing they read on CNN as if it were a personal insight (”I’m predicting now that Harris will take Vermont and the Pope will carry the Vatican”).\n\nBut what we can decisively say at this juncture is that of the four options – Trump easy win, narrow win; Harris narrow win, easy win – the Harris easy win is off the table. Despite January 6, a rape trial, “eating the pets” and a comedian calling Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage”. I wonder if Joe Biden might have done better?\n\n**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/its-beginning-to-look-like-donald-trump-is-going-to-win/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/its-beginning-to-look-like-donald-trump-is-going-to-win/)",

I think if you click on each state you can see what the % the vote count is at. A news broadcast like NBC will be more cautious before calling based on the overall percentage of votes or rural vs urban centres. For example, in 2020, Arizona was erroneously called by some networks which was too close and too early to call.",

That has become \"normal\" for millions, including myself. A lot of people were manipulated into feeling ashamed for supporting Trump 8 years ago.\n\nI'm happy that the conversation was eventually had with OP and Dad.\n\nWe can't let the mainstream media dictate our conversations with FAMILY!!! Or for that matter.... friends and family, or anyone else.\n\nIt's a Liberal tactic to scare people into not using their 1st amendment rights!\n\nAs a 40 year old, I bought my MAGA hat 9 months ago. I was initially afraid to wear it in my incredibly liberal state. I was afraid to wear a fucking hat! Eventually,  I said fuck this. I'm not going to be silenced. Oddly enough, the response by people was far more positive than negative.",

That has become \"normal\" for millions, including myself. A lot of people were manipulated into feeling ashamed for supporting Trump 8 years ago.\n\nI'm happy that the conversation was eventually had with OP and Dad.\n\nWe can't let the mainstream media dictate our conversations with FAMILY!!! Or for that matter.... friends and family, or anyone else.\n\nIt's a Liberal tactic to scare people into not using their 1st amendment rights!\n\nAs a 40 year old, I bought my MAGA hat 9 months ago. I was initially afraid to wear it in my incredibly liberal state. I was afraid to wear a fucking hat! Eventually,  I said fuck this. I'm not going to be silenced. Oddly enough, the response by people was far more positive than negative.",
