"finally a sane idea.

I've been saying for years if politicians where serious about deportation and the border they would give jail time for hiring an illegal.

I guarantee if you give a year in jail for every illegal immigrant you hire.  They would instantly all leave and stop coming here.

But to many companies have interest groups that pay politicians that prevent them from fixing the border.

They always say they will do something then never do because companies who donate to their super PAC like hiring illegal immigrants.  

An emergency order is for an emergency and they will just come back, it's stupid and a misuse of the power.  If they solve the actual issue of companies hiring these people it would be solved and stay solved.

By getting rid of cheap labor undocumented labor would make it more difficult to build cheap houses.

I would imagine this only having a net negative impact on housing costs,  even if illegals aren't working in construction, they might be picking up trash, or landscaping, all of which means HOAs having to hire more expensive workers.

Rich guys especially in other countries love buying up houses as a way to protect their money.  They tend to pay whatever the asking price is for just to hide their money from their country because America is a stable country and real estate always goes up.

Zoning restrictions are sort of weird, but also prevents many locations from being built because of weird rules, and nobody really wants to change it because it would cause real estate values to drop.

I dont really understand it, America has a crazy high price for houses while other countries have TO many houses often.  It's kinda of weird.  I think because Americans tend to want to live in houses instead of apartments maybe?

"I was a police officer in a sanctuary city, Houston.

I'm not sure about the act you listed but illegal immigrants do not qualify for SNAP or housing assistance or anything.  

When I say illegal immigrant, I'm reference people who cross the border illegally and work here or something.


However, they do give money to people who are undocumented and food stamps.   

When I say undocumented I am referring to someone who normally comes here without a passport and unexpectedly.  Normally seeking asylum.

In order to seek asylum you need to first come here and stay without any documentation often and apply for it.  They often are given handouts to help them when they first get here while their case is looked at.  Only people from certain countries and situations can apply for asylum.


I understand it's a bit confusing but just because someone is here with no id or passport doesn't make them here illegally.  They are in a sort of purgatory while they go through the legal system.


Most illegals actually pay taxes, and few commit crimes their crime rate is slightly lower then the average American.  It's hard to avoid sales tax when you buy something or property tax when it's included in your rent.  

If your hiding from the government, committing a crime makes you stand out and they try to avoid that.

Throughout this entire war, I've been gritting my teeth seeing how much territory Ukraine has lost against Russia, all because we couldnt supply them with adequate amounts of weapons. I mean really, whats 30 or so Abrams tanks going to do to shape the war in Ukraine. Thats a tiny, tiny amount in the grand scheme of things but yet, its touted as some game breaking wonderweapon that can turn the tides of war. 

The same goes for all the other Nato weapons that have been delivered. Anything less than a couple hundred leopard 2s, challenger 2s or F16s will barely make a dent in the frontline. Earlier this week, i saw some news reporting that France is sending a whopping SIX Mirage 2000s to ukraine. SIX OF THEM. Thats a tiny amount. Not even enough for one squadron. 

Under Biden, the Ukraine war would forever be locked in a eternal stalement with Ukraine slowly but steadily losing ground with occasional weapons aid delivers coming in the form of like, 10 more Abrams tanks and 30 more howitzers. They're just enough to keep the frontline from collapsing, but not enough to change things.

"Because as much as I'd like for peace and prosperity between our nations, China and Russia work against our interest and our people.  Foe they also see us as their enemies and rivals.

A quote from the U.S Government of Accountability Office on China ""China‚Äôs harmful and unfair economic practices, including trade in illicit goods, use of forced labor, and theft of sensitive technologies pose risks to the U.S. economic and security interests. China is also developing its military capabilities, posing challenges to the U.S. military"". They're oppressive regimes who, outside of oppressing their own people, also harm the peace and stability in their region. China threatens our allies in the region including Taiwan, Philippines, Japan and South korea whilst working to undermine our own capabilities. 

Russia on the other hand is gearing up its entire society for war. They're indoctrinating their kids to hate on the West so that in the future, they have a steady supply of fresh recruits. All the while they're economy is transitioning to a war time economy in preparation for a war. 

In the event that either of these nations get their way, we'd see the thin peace and stability we enjoy, be shattered as they start world war three over the ambitions of one foolish man.

Now I will put forward that there are other reasons to support more efficient energy sources/production.

Some sources of energy are not efficient, coal being a prime example; coal power plants that operate in the US have an efficiency of about 33%.

"Climate change is a problem we have to deal with, that is a must. Doesn't matter if you're a republican or democrat. If anything us republicans should encourage alternatives more, so less government intervention is required in our daily life regarding emissions.

What is a bigger issue to me is why the hell would some of you think that governments, private research, universities and etc are employing hundreds and thousands of people all over the world with a ton of money to sit around and try to convince you to lower your emissions and recycle? You not buying more things which are created by making more emissions and waste (makes you richer not companies) or you literally using two garbage bags one for recycle and another for regular, that doesn't benefit anyone financially. There's no global agenda to fool some random carpenter down in Iowa dude. Move on, understand you're not at the center of the universe. If you're brain cannot grasp these concepts in a simple BIO1000 or even a children's book, you can create these experiments for yourself.

Take 3 small plants. Water one regularly, the other over water and another water irregularly. Keep the sunlight as a constant. Some of them will die depending on the species. Just because us humans have a crazy ability to adapt doesn't mean other species can.

OR

Take a cup, put some freezing temp water (the same freezing temp you follow for snow directions) and throw a cube of ice on it and mark the water level once they're both in the freezer. Now lower the degree of the freezer by a tiny degree or two. Recheck the new water level. This is the hard part, imagine that the water is the ocean, and there's hundreds of these ice cubes but the size of texas. I'm sure you can see how a global rising of the temp can create a lot of excess water.

You can try those without any government or private agency employing hundreds of thousands of 9-5ers all around the world to try and fool you for an unprofitable cause. 

As for historical context, yes global warming and cooling has happened in the past. But the Earth being a simple 10¬∞F cooler was a considered an ice age and if you're wondering if humans would enjoy that go watch the Ice Age movie series maybe it will help you visualize the climate lol. Ideally whenever the next Ice Age is we should work towards mitigating it's effects and not try to bring it closer, unless you want your future generations to freeze over and turn into biological/historical studies to see how the people of a region died during a freeze.

Will sufficient battery backup be afforded to produce name plate capacity until that ice and snow has melted off.

And that really isnt shocking considering it was they who immigrated to the U.S legally like everyone else, only to be lumped in the same category as illegal immigrants. Of those illegal immigrants, they end up being abused and raped by the cartel just to cross into America. So by all means, a safer and more secure border would end up benefitting the hispanic population.",2024-11-18 01:43:20,negative,0.622,0.622,0.3289,0.0491,r/Republican

"Now, among the children of the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need no man‚Äù segment of the black American community, there is indeed an educational crisis. Sadly, lowering the standards isn‚Äôt the answer. 

The beginning of the answer is a repeal of family-killing , LBJ-era measures like Title IV-D (which is a welfare recovery program thatcompensates the states for every dollar of child support they collect). This program creates a clear conflict of interest where juicy federal dollars come before the best interests of the child and intact families.

Republican politicians were loathe to touch this for fear of losing the female vote. The recent election cycle busted that right open, so anyone who would have been alienated is already alienated.

Remember..prior to LBJ and the DNC‚Äôs so-called ‚ÄúGreat Society Reforms‚Äù, black American families were among the highest in terms of intact, 2-parent families. Black wealth was on an upward trajectory as was achievement. The Democrats made policies that literally paid black women to have no fathers in the home. They did this for votes, which is beyond criminal. Anyone unfamiliar should do a YouTube search for the ‚ÄúMoynihan Report‚Äù to see the devastating effects of LBJ‚Äôs policies. The demographic that previously had over 87% of intact families now has 87% broken homes. Again, this is akin to genocide and is a prime reason for poor educational outcomes.

When Kamala and the DNC realized how badly they were hemorrhaging black male votes, they came up with a last-minute ‚Äúempowerment plan.‚Äù The plan? Marijuana and more loans to keep them chained to their government. Basically ‚ÄúHey you losers‚Ä¶here‚Äôs some reefer!‚Äù

"At the dawn of the 20th century, Republicans were dominate in the country, and the Democrats mostly only existed as an opposition party. Northern Republicans favored business and Southern Republicans favored civil right, so early-1900-Democrats were against both of these.

Early in the 20th century, there was a split in Republican ideology: Theodore Roosevelt continued to favor more progressive policies (labor laws protecting women and children; wilderness conservation; pro-union), while William Taft favored more conservative policies (high tariffs to help domestic production; against labor-laws; for the popular election of judges).

That ideological divide let the Democrat Woodrow Wilson get elected for two terms as president, but otherwise the first third of the 20th century was all Republicans presidents running on pro-business platforms, and business was booming and Republicans got much of the credit.

Then when the stock market crashed in 1929, Republicans got most of the blame, allowing Democrat FDR to win office. Franklin Roosevelt had new ideas on how the Democratic party should work, which allowed the Democratic Party to reinvent itself as the New-Deal party and that let the Dems dominate for the next 30 years, with Republicans as the opposition party.

Messiness surrounding the civil rights movement gave both parties a chance to reinvent themselves, but I'd argue that Republicans didn't develop a national identity again until Ronald Reagan.

"Full disclosure: I consider myself an independent, not a Republican, and I'm not especially happy with where the Republican party has gone. I try to respect the partisan nature of the subreddit, but still take what I say with a grain of salt.

After Reagan, neo conservativism became the dominant voice in the Republican Party controlling the party for the first decade or so of the 21st century. Neocons favor free-market domestic policy and interventionist foreign policy. They don't necessarily relish warfare, but that ""interventionist foreign policy"" will often lead to wars, which is why people call them ""war hawks"". W Bush was a neo conservative, as was his vice-president Dick Cheney.

The Tea Party was the other big conservative movement of the early 21st century, a grass-roots movement that pushed for fiscal responsibility and accountability. They had a big influence on congressional elections circa 2008-2016, especially Republican wins in 2010.

"I'll give you that, yes, I was making some assumptions for the sake of an argument. 

Education level I see get skirted quite often, yes.  The ""job requirements"" for education is a recommendation and is never set in stone, experience matters more. So I'd be interested in how many of those ""skating"" education has the years of experience instead? Probably a notable amount. And if you're involved in hiring, you know that HR literally scores resumes based on years of experience, which may make them more qualified than someone who just graduated with a PHD. 

I don't know about the criminal records, I find that  hard to believe. Usually if you have even a DUI you get flagged before the interview process and don't get a chance due to HR. So I'd be interested in what you mean by ""criminal records"" as I feel most governments have a pretty good background check for that. 

I still thinks vets shouldn't get points, it's not fair. Just cause you served doesn't mean you are more qualified for the position, sometimes maybe, but not always.

I also don't believe that someone who served in the military deserves preferential points. Anyone can sign up to join the military, I definitely respect that decision 200%.

"This is one of the first times I agreed with a republican talking point.

Democrats are very elitist and tend to act like they are better than others because of their intelligence or actions, etc.

Unfortunately, Trump's party while it may not have the same issues has its own issues.

It's unfortunate that the Republican party has become a cult that follows trump (BTW previously a Democrat) that has dropped their core values to simply get into office.

Both parties are disconnected from reality.  

I can't handle the disrespect of Trump's party, lack of ethics, and the flat out lies.

I can't handle the democratic party lack of ethics, elitism, out of touch with society.

The entire reason a country is strong is because of its unity,  no matter your beliefs as long as they align with the group/country it makes that country stronger.   Having a massive split preventing the ability to work together that we currently have only paralyzes the country from doing anything.


Historically the only time a split in culture is resolved is with a civil war and new countries created.

No matter your beliefs, our country is literally forever stuck voting on abortion.  It CAN NOT be solved, instead of voting on issues that actually effect our lives, we are stuck voting on a stupid issue that doesn't effect 99.9999% of us.

Think about how rare an abortion is.  Yet people will vote on that single issue.  (Abortion is a example there are a few other big examples).  Republicans and Democrats are both guilty of this, although Republicans started it.  They all make it sound like we have to voted based on this issue.

I can go on forever but voting on the issues that have no resolution, simply paralyzes our country, how often has our government been shutdown because nobody can agree.  Or think about how often a party just cock blocks a bill or pick for a position just to prevent the government from functioning.


Half the population is men where abortion will never apply, and most women won't ever need an abortion.  Why does it even matter if it's legal or illegal it doesn't effect you ever.


And if u wanna protect life, guys I'm sorry to tell you this but we are constantly sending people off to war, executing prisoners and killing animals for food.  Life sucks and death is a part of life infact without death we can't have life.   

btw life doesn't start at conception, life started 2-5 billion years ago and has never stopped.  Life doesn't start like a light switch.  It's always going.  

I'm getting way off topic but both parties piss me off.  Our country is in a downhill spiral and I understand many people voted for trump because they wanted change.  But his changes are not going to make anything better.",2024-11-16 19:26:21,negative,0.9219,0.9219,0.0714,0.0067,r/Republican

"In 2021 California generated $488M of revenue and received $143M in federal grants, which would rank California as the 9th most contributory state to federal funds. This has been a consistent trend for years now. I'm not really sure where this narrative that FINANCIALLY California is a failed state came from. The state prints money, that doesn't mean they SPEND it right. But California rakes cash in. 

In 2024, approximately 32% of California's state revenue was from federal funding, ranking at about #40 in the nation. States actually propped up by the federal government are:



Louisiana - 52% (!!) of state revenue provided by federal government

Alaska - 50% of state revenue provided by federal government 

Arizona - 47% of state revenue provided by federal government

Mississippi - 47% of state revenue provided by federal government

Missouri - 45% of state revenue provided by the federal government 



If government efficiency is going to actually happen, we all need to collectively open our eyes and read the numbers. It's ok to not like California, it's not ok to dislike facts. What the hell is happening in the states I listed that causes them to need HALF their budget from the federal government? DOGE should heavily focus in those states.

"But he was given a chance. And half the country hated him. Republicans didn‚Äôt even initially want him in the 2016 primaries but his charisma carried him through. Hell even a ton of republicans don‚Äôt like him now. Looking at voter turnout he had less votes than last time. And when you consider there was a shift of blues turning red that means he lost a lot of original reds. Several big time long term republicans even turned on him and endorsed Kamala. The only reason he won was because Kamala was a terrible choice forced in by the DNC. She wasn‚Äôt even a great choice as VP to Biden. They only won last time because Biden had popularity from Obama and he was (anyone but Trump). 

I do agree the hitler crap needs to stop. Also both parties need to stop crying fascist, Russian puppet, day one impeachments and so on. I personally think Trump was a terrible pick and his cabinet of who‚Äôs popular atm rather than who‚Äôs the best in their field is almost as bad as his last term of hiring his family into high power positions.

"Eh there are a lot of things stated in that.  It would take me forever to look into each one.

Apples have aresnic in them that doesn't mean they will kill you.

But my point is we have a FDA in order to perform investigations into these things,  having a person who has political interests and his own opinions on what's bad doesn't make things safe.

You need independent studies that test these things and are constantly monitoring foods/drugs in order to figure these things out.

Having ANY political involvement prevents this from happening, remember he is a politician who wants to be elected, he is not the scientist performing the studies he can only parrot information he thinks will win him support.

I'm not saying he's right or wrong.  But when you have someone that has something to gain involved in deciding what's is safe or not it becomes a huge problem.

Just because something is dangerous sounding or can cause cancer in high doses, or is a poison does not make it dangerous.  You gotta remember often times when testing in rats they will use 10000 times the dose before they become dangerous.  


Many many many things become dangerous in high amounts, but when used correctly are safe.


I'm not saying these things are not dangerous and they very well might be, but before the FDA they had cocaine and heroin in everything,  they had lead in almost everything.   The average life span was like 30-40, we have made huge progress in this day and age but that's because we used scientific analysis and non-bias testing to get here.  We can't have a person who has already made a decision about something running or a part of the agencies.

We need someone who will look at actually scientific studies or even perform them to get to the bottom of it.

CEOs and politicians have interests in the out come so will view data in a bias view.

It must be very difficult waking up on the morning of November 6th and realizing that the vast majority of America doesn‚Äôt think like you do. That the nation has rejected far-left socialist, Marxist and communist ideologies. Rejected radical progressivism and unchecked liberalism.

But this election proved that America isn‚Äôt falling for the propaganda, lies, gaslighting, projection, anymore. This 2024 victory was bigger than 2016. The media made it seem like the Left are the majority when in fact they are the small fringe minority. The media was protecting the corrupt system that the democrats are a part of. The small fringe minority is typically the actual cult. Not the vast majority of a nation. 


You probably fell for all of the hoaxes, lies and propaganda because you likely get your news from the fake news. CNN, MSNBC, Yahoo News, Newsweek, AP, Reuters, MSN, The Hill, The Atlantic, The Guardian, The NY Times, The Washington Post. It‚Äôs all fake news pushing the same propaganda.

"I don‚Äôt think DeSantis will wait that long to announce a Senator. The confirmation hearings will happen after Inauguration Day which is also after the new senate is confirmed, right? He‚Äôll have to appoint someone before then. 

Side note: my gut tells me that DeSantis might nominate himself for Senate. That will allow his lieutenant governor to take over now and then still win two more elections so she would be able to serve 10 years. She‚Äôs a Cuban American very similar to Rubio, and she‚Äôs already represented Miami Dade county. So I feel as though she would not have any trouble with elections. Then, that gives DeSantis a job after his term limits are up and continues a job for him if he doesn‚Äôt win the presidency in 2028. 

And to your question about Gaetz specifically. Let‚Äôs assume for these purposes he didn‚Äôt sex traffic anyone, use drugs, or share inappropriate images on the House floor all like he was accused of. I personally would like my representative to not be accused of that many different issues, but I understand sometimes accusations happen whether they are true or not.

He pledged to serve three terms because he said he believes in term limits and even co-sponsored a resolution to the House about 3 terms for House representatives. Yet, he was just elected to his fifth term. Did he decide that he actually did not want term limits? Did he decide that three years was not enough for a House representative? We will never know because he never comes down here unless it‚Äôs to campaign for himself or someone else.

He has never debated anyone running against him
In the primaries or general election. Why? Great question. I‚Äôd love to know the answer to. Again, could be arrogance because he knows he‚Äôs going to get reelected in our area? Possibly. Other people in our area deserve to hear from him, hear his views compared to somebody else, and why he‚Äôs the best choice for the role. Especially in the primaries. What separates himself from the other Republican candidates?

The whole ouster of Kevin McCarthy didn‚Äôt sit right with me. He single handily made House Republicans look like idiots. If you do not agree with committeeships or House rules, have discussions. Try to come up with agreements. And if nothing comes of it, you only have to wait two years before the speaker can change and then you can make your voice heard and known before he is granted the role. My theory? He just wanted to say that he has been the only person to help oust the house speaker. Again, contributes to his arrogance. am I wrong? Possibly. But again, he never comes down here to talk to the people for us to know what exactly his process was. Would‚Äôve loved to hear that in a debate format.

On December 19, 2017, Gaetz was the ONLY representative to vote against the Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act. The vote was 418-1. He‚Äôs the 1. He also voted against the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act in 2018. The vote count was 388‚Äì25. In 2022, he also voted against Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act, which passed 401‚Äì20. Which I understand if you have firm belief that these are not good bills, you have a right as a representative to vote against them. But if you have sex trafficking allegations against you, voting against all these measures is not a good look.

I have three pretty strong Republican friends that I talk to on a daily basis about politics. Two of which are pretty MAGA heavy. Even they both agree that they don‚Äôt like Gaetz as a person, but they keep voting for him because they like his politics. Wow that‚Äôs a very small sample size of our area, I feel like that‚Äôs probably how much Republicans think. Nobody in this area really likes him.

Americans *used to do* those jobs, our country was better for it, and a large part of the reasons why Americans won't do them now is because the 40 million illegal aliens in the country have driven down wages for unskilled labor to at or below minimum wage, and the work requirement for welfare has been waived in a lot of states.",2024-11-13 19:09:28,negative,0.5695,0.5695,0.37,0.0605,r/Republican

"You forgot: to take care of their elders. I work in the elderly housing and you would be surprised at how many homes run on illegal labor. When I have to compete with the other business the same question comes up: why do you charge so much? It is because I abide by labor laws. I barely am able to pay for the mortgage after paying for employment legally. So much so the only payout for me is the payment of selling the property. I was misled when I was told that the elderly housing is a lucrative business, it is only lucrative if you run on illegal labor and assisted with someone that works in the discharge center that can give biased direction to the family as to where to place their elderly with needs (which is also illegal, but happens more times than not). 

Unrelated, to the post but an additional Tid bit, what the agents in this industry do is legal but it will likely make you sick. They charge 100% 1st months rent or more (like a place for mom) directly to the facility providing the service. Even though the extent of the work provided is texting the facility to schedule an appointment and making sure to show the clients 3 homes(there's a free government website that lost these places and how well they perform). All of the admission paperwork and testing is done by the facility. That looks like $5,000-10,000 paycheck from the facility to the agents. If you ever find yourself needing care for your elderly please do not use an agent or go to a place with illegal labor. If you do both you will likely pay the same as if you went to a place with illegal labor and found it through agent.
P. S. There is a government aid program from Mastercareplan.com through Medicaid. The agents hate this program because they are not allowed to charge their ridiculous finders fees and most will never even mention it.",2024-11-13 19:58:57,negative,0.7643,0.7643,0.2095,0.0262,r/Republican

Leftists have lost it lmao. AOC in this scenario is an awful person who thrives off people who are in bad environments. For those who aren't in NYC let me give you a synopsis.

Essentially, she tries to maintain her neighrborhoods who vote for her by destroying opportunities for other neighrbodhoods which harbor middle class people or individuals who have helped their local area/zipcodes go up in value. She does this by banning or stopping projects which promise a large number of jobs and tax dollars for the city like Amazon. 

Her reasoning is always she wants to protect her people from being displaced. But what she doesn't say loud is the fact that she wants to perpetually keep her constituents in poor conditions because if they have their own wit and finance to stand on, then she has no job. Her job isn't to maintain the level of income and harbor a large amount of transitioning illegal migrants, it is the serve her constituents and provide opportunities working with the city. 

During her time she has done absolutely nothing of substance, no community outreach, no programs for her low income constituency to achieve higher education, no lessening of crime under her. All she has done is stopped areas from moving up in the income bracket to ensure her constituents remain in dingy, illegal migrant infested and crime ridden neighborhoods because the very next election cycle she will promise the same things which is ""I won't abandon you"". My question is, what happens when she is gone? This people will be displaced harder than ever, more than that completely underprepared because they were abandoned by their leader who refused to provide them any help to climb the financial ladder of our society. All because she wanted to cyclically farm votes. She has made her constituents abandon the American dream and sold them a version of salvation she is offering while forsakening the working class nearby. 

She is a disease which infects my city, and there are many more like her. The sooner we get her out the better we will be and we will enable these low income neighborhoods to climb the income ladder and find their own properties to live in, not income assisted housing or projects which are both proved by neumerous studies to only keep low income people in low income brackets because they fear being kicked out and their kids are surrounded by gang violence which inevitibly influences many.

"What I was trying to say was that your interpretation that people believe white men are the enemy is irrational. People do not think that (at least sensible people) and I believe that is a convenient exaggeration. She‚Äôs not a good spokesperson here, so I don‚Äôt blame you for being dumbfounded by her remarks. There are people who can better articulate the sentiment, which is not to vilify any demographic, but to acknowledge that there is a dominant demographic, and due to this, many social structures in our society have used white male formatting as the standard. Many people recognize this and would appreciate more nuance and a displacement of that standard to afford other demographics more growing power. 

Now, I agree that my response lacks depth. I wasn‚Äôt planning to go into depth initially because I wasn‚Äôt sure how you‚Äôd respond. But I will say that, yes, there were many dynamics of the time. But it is true that American land was rightfully preoccupied. Before the arrival of Europeans, including the English, North America was home to a vast number of Indigenous nations with their own governments, cultures, economies, and ways of life. Colonization disrupted and, in many cases, attempted to destroy these societies through war, disease, and forced assimilation. English colonists, along with other European powers, pursued a policy of settler colonialism, in which they claimed land, established permanent settlements, and sought to displace or eliminate Indigenous populations. European powers, including England, justified their claims to land in the Americas through legal and religious doctrines such as the ‚ÄúDoctrine of Discovery,‚Äù which allowed Christian nations to claim lands ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù by their explorers. This doctrine dismissed the sovereignty of non-Christian peoples, leading to land seizures and disregard for Indigenous ownership. This is particularly personal for me because I was raised in a state where there were a lot of reservations. I understand you can‚Äôt rewrite the past but having perspective can afford us understanding. This may have been an honorable and legal acquisition on the part of settlers but not on the part of those who had been completely disregarded at the time and still are today.",2024-11-13 18:21:52,neutral,0.481,0.4658,0.481,0.0532,r/Republican

Certainly context and perspective matters and it gets us nowhere being the kind of person that is willing to ignore context, etc. to push that narrative.

"Yeah, one bad apple ruins the whole batch. I completely agree. It is unfortunate that there are people who go out of their way to spout hateful nonsense which ultimately causes movements with genuine intentions to lose credibility. I deeply despise that. No one today is responsible for what happened so long ago, but I will say that I receive a lot of push back (and I assume this is where the downvotes are coming from) when I talk about how history has lingering effects, especially when the actions that took place were so severe. While I understand that vilifying anyone today for such things is useless, it‚Äôs important that we recognize that time is fleeting but it‚Äôs also permanent. What happened some 500 years ago contributed and likely still contributes to the society we live in today. For example, you should feel empowered and righteous in celebrating your ancestry, but you can only imagine how indigenous people feel having lost so much of their ancestry to tragedy. Thus, their population is still impacted today.

I think the main issue is that, as long as there are people who still remember the past, it‚Äôs going to be hard to move forward without some form resentment toward one thing or another. I think the vilification of White males isn‚Äôt warranted and only further divides us. It also fosters resentment amongst every demographic for absolutely any reason that is available. We can recognize that our society has evolved, but it has evolved within a particular context. This nation started with a primary demographic and it‚Äôs going to be that way for a long time. Thankfully, time has afforded us perspective and we‚Äôve found new ways to adapt to a society that is more suitable for other classes of people. This is modern America. But now, the new task will be to figure out how we can build a society that can express ideas without burning bridges in the process.

White privilege is definitely a thing and there‚Äôs lots of research and data that can cite that. It‚Äôs not an excuse to be rude to people, but if we don‚Äôt recognize that it exists we can‚Äôt move forward. I‚Äôve received lots of push back on that but I‚Äôve even seen it evidenced in my own family who is mixed. My uncle is white and has talked about multiple occasions where he‚Äôs received completely different treatment than my aunt (African American). This is all a consequence of slavery and segregation where white men/women were made to be the standard and it unfortunately takes a really long time for society to assimilate to a more acceptable structure that does not inherently create a hierarchical model of value in human beings. So yes we must move forward somehow but once everybody can come to the consensus that such things do exist, first, then we can. But there are people who deny that certain social structures have ever existed, though history has culminated them, evidently. No one needs to feel ashamed of themselves for what their ancestors did, but we do have to be able to say that something was morally wrong and then move forward as a unit.

His appointment is one of the most highly anticipated in Trump's cabinet as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza rage on.

¬†¬†¬†I really do worry about all the young people who are vulnerable with developing minds and who may be autistic and are being told they‚Äôre something they‚Äôre not, exploited rather than given the care and support they need to eradicate the delusional thoughts. Kids are easily influenced by the internet, peer groups and celebrities/icons they like. So it‚Äôs important that their parents are monitoring who and what they have access to, not in a controlling abusive way, but in a parental loving way. Too many parents just don‚Äôt care or don‚Äôt see what the big deal is. If I had a child who told me their best friend suddenly wanted to swap genders, I‚Äôd probably suspect their home life is full of neglect and have to cut the friendship off to protect my own child from being influenced by dysfunction. It‚Äôs a hard choice that too many parents aren‚Äôt willing to make, but many are and their kids go on to develop healthy and have firm boundaries. I‚Äôd also find it inappropriate for my child to be around peers who are obsessed with sex and gender. It‚Äôs kinda creepy. But I would wish those kids well and hope they seek therapy for the trauma they have experienced that is causing them to disassociate from their own bodies.

I think that no matter who ran, Trump was going to win, and Democrats needed to stop beating themselves up over a race they couldn't win without turning the clock back to 2016 and using the time they had in the House and Senate differently.

"It is sad. The Democratic Party is using mass media to manipulate people just like Hitler manipulated his own people to come to accept the annihilation of the Jewish population in concentration camps. The left always accuses the other party of what they‚Äôre doing themselves.

They separated people into race and gender, which is what Hitler did with the ‚Äúaryan race‚Äù and the ‚Äújews‚Äù. The Democratic Party also weaponized the justice department against their political opponent to try to imprison him. They tried to assassinate Trump. They tried to erase history by removing monuments all over the US. They also told the entire country that if they don‚Äôt vote for them, that they‚Äôre nazis. 

The Democratic Party also infiltrated the department of education and began to indoctrinate children. They told children that they had no identity. They also control most university campuses, where they continue to indoctrinate young adults. They‚Äôre pro-war, and they blatantly sided with the Palestinians because they apparently hate the Jews.

Funny how they claim to be the party of ‚Äúunity‚Äù and ‚Äútolerance‚Äù and they dare call themselves the DEMOCRATIC party. Also remember, the democrats created the Ku Klux Klan, very likely stole the 2020 election and installed Kamala Harris, she was never voted in a primary. They are also communists.

"Good freaking god these people are unhinged idiots. She's saying she's scared of having children. How could someone get like this on their own? The answer is that she did not get like this on her own. She was influenced, and the democrat media were successful in making this unhinged idiot their pawn.

This is what happens when a weak mind is influenced by MSNBC and CNN. She probably thinks Trump is Hitler. She probably thinks that this is going to be a dictatorship. She probably thinks that the military is going to travel around and take Kamala voters away and put them in camps. This is the kind of person that you need to send over to the MSNBC studio and say ""SEE!!! LOOK AT WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO THE WEAK MINDED!!"". But of course that's what they wanted to do with all that fear talk before the election.

"I hate to be that ‚Äúnot all women‚Äù person lol but also‚Ä¶ not all women üòÇ I think leftism is designed to make women as weak as possible and to cultivate all the potential flaws of the feminine nature, including the one you just pointed out. 

Women are more prone to hysterical emotions and logical fallacies in a similar way men are more prone irrational anger and aggression but a good culture and environment can teach us to steer away from those weakness and embrace our strengths.

I was raised by tough women in a mostly male dominated environment and I‚Äôm really grateful that I was raised to prioritize feeling strong, not feeling safe. Unfortunately many women on the left are receiving terrible messaging that encourages them to lean into a lack of logical thinking. 

Also I too definitely fell for the bandwagon fallacy! It‚Äôs actually so incredibly effective in manipulating the public, it‚Äôs insane.

As many people voted against the left as they did for ""maga.""    

Trump since the election has been awesome and magnanimous.   What he said about Haley and Pompeo is exactly how he should act.  And it's how his supporters.   This insistent pound of flesh on anyone who isn't a populist is stupid.  We are a big tent party.   There will be ""liberal"" republicans, and ""non-maga"" republicans, and traditional conservative republicans, and maga republicans.  

They all need to get along, because somehow someway they're all elected.  So they represent SOMEONE.  (More than someone, their constituency).  

In 2024, neocons are a myth.   Maybe in 2004 it was a thing, but not in 2024.  And if you think support for Ukraine is a neoconservative thing, you're an idiot that does not understand geopolitics.   The US has a longstanding tradition of opposing tyranny and invasions, it has a longstanding tradition of defending its interests abroad since Tripoli...that's not an endorsement of the second Iraq war, but it's certainly not an endorsement of isolationism either.  

There needs to be a Thermidorean Reaction in the GOP, that accommodates both the traditional strong foreign policy of Teddy Roosevelt, Eisenhower, and Ronald Reagan, and the populist movement.   

RINOs are a myth.   And if you call someone who has been a republican for 50 years a RINO or neo-con, you're the RINO.   

There will never, ever be a party that perfectly aligns with your ideology or emotions.  Nor should they be.  

When people on social media engage in ideological purity tests, whether progressive or populist, I make the quote reasonable assumption:

They ain't ever been married.  

They ain't ever managed anything, that requires consolidating a dozen different opinions into a working solution.  

They're in a basement somewhere, pushing their idealism to the fullest because they've never had to negotiate or *trade* (one of the fundamental components of the free market, and thus conservatism, and thus the GOP) to get anything done.   

Life is about collaboration and compromise for the greater good.   In a week, Trump has been decent in that regard.   His dedicated fanbase?  Eh, we'll see if they learn.",2024-11-12 16:06:27,negative,0.5383,0.5383,0.3866,0.0752,r/Republican

"A Republic with democratic elections meaning elections where the voice of the people is supposed to elect representatives who are then tasked with ruling in the name of the people via a majority of representatives‚Ä¶ 
Aka a democracy. 
""a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives""

The idea that the USA is not a democracy is simply not correct. 
While a Republic doesn‚Äôt have to be democratic the USA prides itself in democratic ideals like free and fair elections and that a MAJORITY is supposed to rule. After all the goal is to get a MAJORITY of representatives. 

The question is therefore not if the USA is democracy but what kind of democracy it wants to be. 

You brought up civil rights. Protecting people. 
In practice your systems means that one side can oppose its will on the others even if more people disagree than agree with that system. 
That‚Äôs a fact. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs comforting to know that every single thing I said in my original comment is true, that a majority of Americans is politically treated with disregard by both sides far too often, that small states have disproportionate power which while historically sound has today a bitter aftertaste for many millions of people or that elections are now more about gaining a majority of representatives than about gaining a majority of voters aka convincing people instead of winning maps, winning voices instead of seats. 

I don‚Äôt know how you judge systems or government but one way I do it is fairness and the election system is unfair to most US-citizens and it effectively increases division because instead of having to find compromise the winner takes all even if in reality it‚Äôs a decision of 50.5% over 47.9% or vice versa as in 2020 where dozens of millions of Americans didn‚Äôt want Biden. 

This ""genius idea"" is no longer working right. It has even helped to push the USA to a place where winning an election results in gleeful cheering or shocked disappointment, where when you frequent different spaces the people on both sides who are committed have one thing in common, their true biggest enemy is the other side and while unfortunately much of the rest of the entire free world is heading down similar paths, the USA leads the charge for a number of reasons.

Where do you think this will all lead in a couple decades? Not in terms of policy of individual presidents and their administration but in terms of the soul of the people. I think that it‚Äôs not going to end well if nothing is done about it and I hope that I am wrong because so far, it has only gotten worse.",2024-11-11 14:14:15,negative,0.6219,0.6219,0.3369,0.0412,r/Republican

"2020 there was a good and valid reason for a recount, this isnt. But they can recount if they want I wont be a hypocrite. The states worked hard to ensure a secure and fair election.  
  
But if I see somehow millions of votes for Harris show up out of the blue....that would be BS or they counted ballots mailed late, or just slipped ones in that weren't valid due to no signature etc. 

It was a close election this year. The end result looks like we beat them overwhelmingly, but it still was a very close election. We accepted biden and everything we warned about came true and worse....they saw it, didnt wanna admit it was a mistake, slowly started admitting it, then forgot it.

This term they better stop ignoring the good changes for granted, and hopefully see that its okay to be wrong.

"It's annoying that I have to defend democrats here, but the difference is between randos on social media claiming it and the sitting president, members of congress, and mainstay news figures claiming it and running with it for years. 

On top of that, the claims themselves are different. Trump claimed voter fraud, i.e., mass fraudulent votes rigging the election from a top-down perspective (while he was president). Hillary claimed in 2016 that Russia basically ran a covert ad campaign to lie to Americans and convince them to vote for Trump. Gore claimed that SCOTUS voted against him unfairly in a recount that he would've won otherwise and... also, butterfly ballots were disfavorable but not necessarily intentional. Hillary conceded the next day, Gore didn't press beyond the SCOTUS ruling, Trump still won't admit he lost and drove his discontent to the Capitol on Jan 6 2021.

If you can't see the difference here, idk what you're looking at. Democrats didn't claim it was ""rigged"" in past years the same way you're implying in this comment.

That being said, any Democrats claiming an issue with this election need to get their shit together. Just as much as Trump needed to when he was claiming election fraud all election night until he was sure that he won. This shit is annoying as fuck and not based in reality at all.

"It's annoying Tucker is ever accepted for info on anything after first he defends himself in a lawsuit saying that he is just entertainment and no one should or even would take him seriously as factual news, and second, he basically single handedly loses fox a lawsuit (they settled so they didn't technically lose sure but they paid more than any media company ever has for defamation) because of his behind the scenes texts where he knew he was lying on air and was making fun of Americans that believed him. If you think those other candidates that don't suck off Trump 24/7 aren't conservatives, then all conservative means is that you're conservative about doing anything with your career beyond sucking off Trump. I like to think conservatism, and by extension, the Republican Party, stand for a little more than that.

That being said, Jan 6 is *mostly* ceremonial, but that doesn't mean that nothing important happens or anything. That's why interrupting it, like only Trump and his followers have ever done since the ECA passed, is a really big deal! 

There's no reason at all to believe Democrats will challenge the Electoral votes of the states like Trump did. States have a right to choose their own electors. At best, Democrats will likely hope that these electors will not be faithful. It didn't impact anything in 2016 when we had more faithless electors than almost ever before, and it probably won't make a difference now. After the electors elect Trump, it will get certified like normal on Jan 6 like it has on every election since the ECA except the one where Trump lost.

"This is a bit of a ‚Äúmark my words‚Äù statement, but I genuinely would not be surprised if we start to see major violence perpetuated by the left over the next four years.

The amount of liberals I‚Äôve encountered that have been openly disappointed about his failed assassination attempts is frightening. And when digging a little deeper, their hatred actually extends to *anyone who votes for him*, in a violent civil war type of way. 

To illustrate how serious this is, these were real-life conversations among educated professionals, not in the anonymous echo chambers of the internet.

My opinion is that the worst thing a normal conservative will think about a normal liberal is that they‚Äôre dumb. But the worst thing a normal liberal will think about a normal conservative is that they‚Äôre dumb and ALSO a Nazi, horrible person, racist, etc.

"Tell me you know nothing about immigration without telling me. 



Generally, someone who entered the U.S. without inspection cannot directly adjust their status to permanent resident within the country due to the ‚Äúinspected and paroled‚Äù requirement, meaning they may need to leave the country and apply for a visa at a consulate. 



Employment not an option. Are you confusing a DACA work permit as a ‚Äúpathway to naturalize‚Äù, because no, DACA is not eligible for that.

"What is true is that in cases of rape and life to the mother there is broad public support for abortion, but in other cases there is not. So state governments like Texas, Florida and so on have attempted to make that the exemption. 

But in practice they have run into issues, which are going to mount and cause public anger unless resolved. 

Those issues are:
1) Sepsis and infections that effectively make the fetus non viable, make women infertile, and result in severe cases in death if left untreated.
2) Slow speed of government bureaucracy vs medical need for near instant answers. A pregnancy can become a threat to the life of a mother in literally minutes, so an hour wait for a decision could mean infertility or death for the mother. 
3) The medical insurance and health industry putting profit over the life of the mother and the child, and literally not bothering to put in the effort to save either. 

I think the problem of the debate, whether you are pro life or pro choice is that laws on abortion are a wishlist, and they don't fix the real ethical and more issues that actually require persuasion of everyone involved and medical advances to increase the chances of survival for the mother and child.

Like in a perfect world, you wouldn't need any laws on abortion. In that world if someone became pregnant, and couldn't take care of the baby, then society would take it on and there frankly wouldn't need to be abortions.

But right now, despite all the medical advances, we have no means to transfer a fetus to an artificial womb, and unfortunately we are unable to save the mother without an abortion. 

The extreme side of the debate, seems to argue the fatalist moral position that it is god's will if the mother or fetus dies, or that we should have no restriction on abortion whatsoever. While some may believe these things, most Americans take abortion as something terrible, but necessary to protect the life of the mother if medical issues happen.",2024-11-10 19:52:50,negative,0.8149,0.8149,0.1727,0.0124,r/Republican

"So I did a little digging and found [this](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/news/public-media-can-improve-our-flawed-democracy).

It turns out they were right, public funded media is actually very common in democracies, and we are the outliers.

From the article:

""Where is the U.S. positioned in terms of democratic health and public media funding, as compared to other countries?

VP: According to The Economist‚Äôs Democracy Index, the U.S. is now considered to be a ‚Äúflawed democracy‚Äù. In terms of its public media funding, it is almost literally off the chart for how little it allocates towards its public media compared to other democracies around the planet. It comes out to .002 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). At $465 million dollars, 2020 federal funding of U.S. public media amounted to just $1.40 per capita. Meanwhile, countries such as the UK, Norway, and Sweden spend close to $100 or more per capita toward their public media.
 

According to your research, how can public media help strengthen democracies?

VP: While our research specifically shows the correlation between strong public media systems and strong democracies, there is a growing body of research that suggests substantial social benefits from strong public media systems, including well-informed political cultures, high levels of support for democratic processes, and increased levels of civic engagement. 
 

What are some arguments against government support of public media? How do you counter these criticisms?

VP: There is a common fear, especially here in the U.S., that government funding of public media creates a dangerous situation where our news organizations will become mouthpieces of the state. While state capture is a legitimate concern, many democracies around the world have figured out how to create strong safeguards to maintain public media‚Äôs independence. Moreover, our research bolsters the argument that a robust public media system is beneficial ‚Äì‚Äì perhaps even essential -‚Äì for maintaining a healthy democratic society.""",2024-11-09 20:30:51,neutral,0.6077,0.1853,0.6077,0.207,r/Republican

I think a lot of people desperately need community, but instead of church, for example, they grab onto woke ideas to be a part of something.  Some go so far as to mutilate themselves for acceptance. The truth is that their capacity for rational thought has been overtaken for the sake of social acceptance.

I think the only cure for the left is within themselves, and no amount of fact and truth can set them free.  Instead, they have to want to seek truth.

Massive anti male agenda openly prioritising mothers interests over children and a serious misrepresentation of science at a UN Commission meeting on family courts and child safety. 

Key UN officials dismissed critical issues like parental alienation as ""pseudo-theories,"" leaving kids vulnerable in abusive homes. 

This bias hurts kids, fathers & even alienated mothers.

"Funny part is the antithesis of most of those statements was already happening with full liberal support.  

For instance, prayer in school they claim will be mandatory or suspension.  Meanwhile in today's world kids that would like to pray in school get suspended all the time for praying, mentioning the bible or God in defense of their point in debates on a myriad of topics.  

Most feminine products and birth control are available at no cost to women, right now, but everyone else is paying for them and you likely won't get the brand and style that you want.  

Equal pay is not much of an issue at the moment as we've been working toward that a long time, however women and minorities often get jobs with less qualifications than white male counterparts to meet various quotas and/or qualify for funding.  

The same party that fought for civil rights and got it done and ended slavery and was fought every step of the way by democrats is now going to stomp all over the rights of the LGBTQ community?  Conservatives believe in true freedom, FOR EVERYONE, not the regulated freedom with oversight the democrats believe in.  We just also believe that children need not be manipulated, coerced, controlled, nor exposed to life altering decisions until they are old enough to understand all the ramifications of those decisions.  Live your life how you want but leave the kids out of it isn't too much to ask.

And of course women are now free to do as they like, including treating abortion as birth control.  The left has no problem with that.  The right wants that to be a last resort and they request not to be forced to pay for it or have the federal government facilitate the killing of the unborn child.  It's a state issue and the degree of involvement should be left up to the state.  Your body, your choice isn't applicable when there's another body killed in the process and another wallet footing the bill.

The same goes for diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, etc. Aside from some genetic causes, these conditions are *almost entirely* reversible with lifestyle changes alone.

"Dependency is both a business and the means to an end. 

First you convince people they are broken. Then you offer them a cure, but not a permanent one. You have to string them along for life. Then you do this tens of millions of times and make a profit. You use that money to buy politicians. When the fabricated crisis is big enough the government steps in and takes over the healthcare system in order to ‚Äúcare‚Äù for the citizens. Along side of this you take away their ability to fight back or challenge you. You take away their ability to revolt. 

Any of this sound familiar? This is the step we are stuck at now. One group trying to break the system another trying to reform or save it. All while telling you that guns are bad and preaching against violence while they themselves increase the vitriolic rhetoric to incite violence against anyone or everyone. 

Going forward: The government uses increased tax dollars (raised from anyone who refuses to be broken and still works) to pay an increased cost for the cure for all of the broken people. Government lackies skim off the top to keep contracts going and raise taxes all under the mantra of ‚Äúthe common good‚Äù.  They do whatever it takes to stay in control lest someone new try and change things. Eventually you have 3 classes of people. The dependent class, the decreasing working class and the government. But now that the government controls who is deemed worthy and who isn‚Äôt, your access to any cures, they can decide who gets them and who doesn‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt have the means of fighting back. If you don‚Äôt stay in line you can just be cut off and die. Eventually, regardless of whether you stay in line or not, they start cutting you off under the guise of ‚Äúsaving society‚Äù and the planet. Reduce the population. Only the chosen survive and continue to perpetuate the system while those at the top reap all of the benefits, you are simply ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to live as long as the bureaucracy decides it benefits them. The end game is a small group of elites who use the population, that they allow to exist, to serve them _however_ they choose to be served.

"Tariffs are designed to force citizens to buy your countries products to help the local economy.

However this assumes your local economy HAS these products.

America is a super power because we are a leader in world trade,  many countries around the world trade and buy/sell to the United States this makes America a rich country, it's also why we have such a powerful navy to protect our trade.

Unfortunately, tariffs move the country towards a isolation which isnt how your increase profits.  All countries thrive when they open trading to other countries.

Tariffs are not something that will help the United States in anyway, especially for products we don't have the ability to make here or have chosen not to, it will simply become a tax on citizens.

This is why Democrats constantly stated this wiill only increase the cost of everything.  

Even if they do what they are meant to and shift products to be made in the United States, it will still increase the cost, because the primary reasonnwe make things in other countries is to reduce costs.

Mix this with deporting immigrants and move towards closing borders will cause an issue filling non skilled jobs.  Only increasing costs even more.

All these will only compound into a depression for our economy and eventually lose as a super power status.

The US has sent untold billions of dollars of aid to Ukraine which has only managed to hold the line, if that. ¬†In reality, without western aid Ukraine would‚Äôve been under complete Russian control a year ago if not earlier so getting out with any land would already be a win. I‚Äôd love for the US to be able to fight a proxy war forever and eventually win, but our country is trillions of dollars in debt and I promise you we‚Äôre aren‚Äôt getting paid back by Ukraine. It‚Äôs an unfortunate situation, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a good answer. It looks like ceding some land to Russia may be the only way to win the war.

\- Harris was never a strong candidate in the 2020 primary, only performing better than Warren (a low bar)  
\- Biden picked her even though she was basically disliked even among progressives  
\- They switch her out, giving her very little time to campaign, and just assume all Biden voters will go for her  
\- The campaign starts technically positive, then all of a sudden, she switches to complete negative, eventually calling Trump a fascist.  
\- Voters were more forgiving of Biden because he was so old and clearly struggling with the job at times, folks had sympathy for him but not for Harris.  
\- Harris basically tried to win over conservatives with token policy gestures and Liz Cheney, which wasn't going to happen  
\- Harris pisses off progressive base by not appealing to any of their pet issues, whether on single payer or foreign policy.  
\- Harris gives no plan for the Ukraine war situation and stays basically silent on the issue.

I've been a dual citizen since birth, so I have always been American and a New Zealander. I grew up in New Zealand and Australia, and moved to America around 2012. 

I didn't like Obama, and I voted for Sanders over Hillary, and then Jill Stein over Hillary. I live in MD so pretty much folks would vote for a glass of water with a D next to it, so got used to my vote being worthless. Except for that time that I voted for Hogan for governor, and somehow he won.

So this election I was finally glad it was over. No more political attack ads, and no more political rallies, and no more Trump is Hitler shit. Then my father went on Facebook...said he was going to move to NZ and all these vile Democrats began rage messaging against him on social media.

This even though it was something they had been planning on considering doing years ago, and they were planning on retiring next year no matter who won.

So I thought, screw this Democrats, I'm re-registering as a Republican. That's really all it took to lose my vote. They sure are working hard to lose votes even from people who voted for them.",2024-11-08 16:18:19,negative,0.7261,0.7261,0.2269,0.047,r/Republican

False.  Hamas is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, as most of the terrorist organizations in the region are.

It wasn't ever ""Palestinian Land"".

> A two-state solution has been on offer for 75 years. 

But the terms of that offer aren‚Äôt fair, it‚Äôs not an equitable solution. If Mexico occupied 3/4 of the US and only left us with a small plot of land - we‚Äôd also fight back and demand a fair share. If you and your family were kicked out of your homes, of course you‚Äôd fight back.

"If you read what Segev actually said, he talks about allowing foreign funding to go to Hamas.  Israel did not create Hamas, and even your site notes that it was a spinoff of the Muslim Brotherhood.

> You think this war started on October 7th???

This one did, yes.  If you want the longer term, it started when Mohammed started a new religion and kept coming up with tenets for it that were attractive to the bandits that were his original followers.  Remember that at the time, most communities in the Middle East were Jewish.

> Palestine has been occupied and oppressed for the better part of 80 years

Much, much longer than that.  Remember that the Jews were living there more than 3000 years ago, according to the Merneptah Stele.  There has never been a country called ""Palestine"", and 80 years ago it was part of the British Mandate.  When the UN's attempt to create a Palestinian state failed (because the Arabs and Palestinians rejected it in favor of war), the British relinquished control in 1948, and the Jewish inhabitants of the area re-established Israel in *their* ancestral homeland.  Of course, all of their neighbors immediately declared war on them - but that followed 30 years of terrorist attacks from Muslims, so it wasn't really a surprise.

Israel's neighbors lost that war.  ...and the war after that.  ...and the one after that.  ...and the one after that, etc., etc.

When you start a war and lose, and the people you attacked take some of your land as a result, you have no one to blame but yourself.

> But the terms of that offer aren‚Äôt fair

As Bill Clinton recently said in a speech, the thing that upset him the most was he had brokered a peace deal, which the Israelis had agreed to, which gave the Palestinians 96% of the Palestinian territories and 17% of Jerusalem to use as their capital.  ...and Arafat rejected it.

Palestinians can suck it now.  The elected a terrorist organization as their government (to replace the previous terrorist organization that was their government), and now they get to reap the rewards of that decision.",2024-11-09 23:59:57,negative,0.7211,0.7211,0.2574,0.0215,r/Republican

I was umpiring a 10U baseball game. The 2nd baseman looked a little girly and they kept calling him Jus which I had thought was short for Justine. He had long beautiful Blonde Hair and very White not albino skin. So I said in-between innings ‚ÄúGentlemen & Lady balls in‚Äù the 1st Baseman looks at me and says ‚ÄúHey Blue who‚Äôs a girl?‚Äù Im like Damm ummm the 2nd baseman? He goes nah that‚Äôs a boy. I was like my bad. He turns to be 2 seconds later..‚ÄùHey Blue, You never know these days‚Äù  So they know and they are resisting this garbage. But it‚Äôs happening in the schools. We MUST teach our children the right way. My son when he was 14 along with his mixed group of friends comes home one day and goes ‚ÄúDad there are only 2 genders right?!?‚Äù So they know they understand and are waking up!",2024-11-08 16:02:36,negative,0.5268,0.5268,0.3762,0.097,r/Republican

‚ÄúRecently, surgeon and WPATH president-elect, Marci Bowers, raised concern that puberty blockers given at the earliest stages of puberty to birth sex males, followed by cross-sex hormones and then surgery, might adversely impact orgasm capacity because of the lack of genital tissue development (Ley, 2021). One study has reported that some young adults, who had received puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and laparoscopic intestinal vaginoplasty, self-reported orgasmic capacity (Bouman et al., 2016). However, this finding does not negate Bower‚Äôs concerns, as it did not make any assessment of the correlation between Tanner stage at initiation of puberty blockers with orgasm outcome. Of note, some of the patients in the study were over the age of 18 at start of GAT. Further, its findings do not apply to those undergoing penile skin inversion vaginoplasty. Importantly, Bouman et al. found that 32% of their participants self-reported being sexually inactive and only 52% reported having had neovaginal penetrative sex more than once. A recent literature review on sexual outcomes in adults post-vaginoplasty noted the paucity of high-quality evidence but reported that ‚Äúup to 29% of patients may be diagnosed with a sexual dysfunction due to associated distress with a sexual function disturbance‚Äù (Schardein & Nikolavsky, 2022). Another recent systematic review of vaginoplasty reported an overall 24% post-surgery rate of inability to achieve orgasm (Bustos et al., 2021).‚Äù",2024-11-08 05:19:22,negative,0.5046,0.5046,0.4527,0.0426,r/Republican

There's a a main mod for the Texas subreddit that is ran by very far leftist that will literally block and kick people out if they say anything that has any right leaning ideology and there's hundreds and thousands of people that make it look like this subreddit is actually for people in Texas in general when it's definitely a leftist agenda pushed subreddit and on top of that that woman who happens to be trans which is unimportant has tried to get control of other subreddits that have to do with Texas, that's dangerous if you think about it like that ideology is getting pushed on to other people and they're thinking that it's okay to push that narrative on to other people. How do far leftist more importantly think that this country is going to last if everyone is thinking the same way? It's really scary.

Tariffs are also much more than just an economic math problem - which is usually what major economists miss.

"Your claim that Pence ‚Äúdid his job‚Äù while knowing the election was ‚Äòrigged‚Äô assumes there was definitive evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. However, extensive investigations, court rulings, and audits‚Äîmany conducted by Republican-led entities‚Äîfound no evidence of widespread fraud that would have changed the election outcome. The Vice President‚Äôs constitutional duty was to oversee the certification of state-certified electoral votes, not to decide their legitimacy based on unsupported claims.

Regarding your comparison between Biden and JFK‚Äôs popularity, popularity is complex and influenced by numerous factors like demographics, media exposure, and social context. Comparing presidential candidates from vastly different eras based solely on public recognition overlooks significant changes in media, technology, and population size. Winning an election depends on votes, not historical legacy or familiarity. In 2020, Biden won more votes than any presidential candidate in history, verified by the electoral process and confirmed by numerous recounts and legal reviews.

Bering merely surprised by the support for Biden is not grounds for a presumption of guilt. Trump‚Äôs overwhelming win this month was shocking, but that does not suggest that it wasn‚Äôt fair. Hypocrisy exists here.",2024-11-08 19:35:18,neutral,0.5046,0.3962,0.5046,0.0993,r/Republican
"Man, what? 

Mike Pence's role in certifying the 2020 election was entirely consistent with his constitutional duty and existing law. The 12th Amendment and the Electoral Count Act (ECA) of 1887 made it clear that the Vice President's role is to preside over the counting of electoral votes submitted by the states, not to unilaterally decide their validity. Any disputes over state-certified votes are resolved by Congress, not the Vice President, which is exactly what happened during the 2020 certification. 

The 2022 Electoral Count Reform Act, which aimed to clarify and modernize the ECA, did not exist at the time and thus has no bearing on Pence‚Äôs actions. He followed the law and fulfilled his constitutional role by overseeing the process without attempting to alter the certified results.

Of everything I have said here, what do you not understand? These are not feelings, these are facts. The arguments I have head against this issue have been purely emotionally charged. It's okay to dislike the outcome of 2020, but to to say it was unconstitutional is **factually** wrong. Stop attacking this man for no reason. He has done nothing for people to say he should be *h\*nged*. That is sick and I absolutely lost respect for a lot of conservatives that day.

The only way we may get national voting reform is if Democrats think Republicans are cheating and that the loose rules are no longer to their advantage.

"I mostly agree with you with one major caveat.  Election abnormalities have to be challenged.  Notice I am not specifying anything in particular like fraud.  I said ""abnormalities.""

This was the big problem with 2020.  There were countless abnormalities, and most of it stemmed from late chances to voting procedures and allowances due to COVID.  Conservatives did not like that at all because on the one hand they were being told it was time to move past COVID while at the same time being told the rules governing voting needed to change because of COVID.  And it needs to be pointed out that years after that election those changes were found by multiple courts to be unconstitutional, so that only adds to the sense many have that 2020 was unjust.  

You do have a problem with colloquial language and pedantic buffoonery on the other. Conservatives foolishly used a common, low brow vernacular to refer to everything they saw wrong about 2020.  That term was ""fraud.""  Well, it wasn't fraud, not by legal definition at least.  But liberals pounced on that and used to declare people guilty of pushing ""misinformation"" and proceeded to have them censored or taken to court.  That was liberal being stupidly and dishonestly pedantic.  They knew damn well what everyone was referring to.  And at the same time Conservatives knew dam well that ""fraud"" was an insufficient blanket term, and they were too stubborn and lazy to address the issue properly.

If liberals see any abnormalities in the voting or counting process, I strongly encourage them to avail themselves of their legal rights to file challenges and request recounts.  And unlike Georgia who violated its own law to deny people hearings, I would urge every court to speedily litigate any and all challenges.  

Challenging election results is not inherently bad or wrong.  If something needs clarification, transparency, or reversal for faith in the system to remain healthy, then that's what needs to happen.  But anyone making those challenges needs to educate themselves first on the issue and speak to it precisely and properly.  And people who don't like the challenge should engage in the process in good faith regardless.",2024-11-07 22:32:38,negative,0.6951,0.6951,0.278,0.027,r/Republican

Give it a nominal fee, with a fee waiver for people below the poverty line, so the problem of people being able to afford it doesn't arise. 

The trouble with requiring state ID to vote is that not all state ID requires proof of US citizenship so what ID you need to show to vote would differ between states, rely on the competence of each state government (remember that mess just a few weeks ago in Arizona where like 200,000 old Arizona residents got disenfranchised because they got their state IDs before the state started checking citizenship?) and end up in a complicated mess. 

Make a federal ID mandatory. Require every citizen show that ID every time they vote, every time they apply for a government benefit, every time they apply for a job, every time they're stopped by the police, every time they interact with any level of American government or do anything else where proof of citizenship is required or beneficial.

Unfortunately abortion is not a right, it‚Äôs a privilege. Since abortion is a service, we don‚Äôt have an unalienable right to abortion, since it‚Äôs predicated on another individual performing that service. 
It should be a states issue, just as our founding fathers intended. It‚Äôs not a *right* that needs to be protected under federal law.

I voted for Trump, but I also voted for abortion access in my state election. A women‚Äôs right to abortion now lies in a state election, and this likely won‚Äôt be a presidential issue ever again.

To each their own, but I find it weird that abortion is a voting issue for some people. It feels like an uninformed take. You want to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù your child getting cream pied and their ability to abort the fetus? Lol. It‚Äôs so strange.

"Project 2025 and the Democrats scare mongering. 

Couple of weeks ago I pointed out on  r/ menopause that Project 2025 was not Trump's platform. Truth. I'm sure I got down voted to heck, but I was so tired of these scare tactics. Then they attacked me bringing up other things unrelated to my post. 

If you believe Project 2025 is what is going to happen (as if all that could happen) then maybe sort of feel like it would be downhill/backwards. But I don't believe it is his platform or that even half of it can be done. Even with having the house and senate, they are unlikely to address all the things in that project especially as it relates to women in 2 years. There are other more important things to address. (2 years being when voting happens again and we could lose the senate or something.) Even if we get all 4, they just aren't going to do everything in that project. 

I have not read the project but was able to gather info about it regarding women. 

One BIG concern they have is not being able to get the abortion pills. 

Personally I'm ok with a morning after, but after several weeks it is too hard on a woman's body. They don't want women to know that it isn't like birth control. It's a medical miscarriage and there might be baby parts the further along. How gruesome to see you killed your baby.

Kamala Harris lost because she didnt get the male vote, plain and simple and the same will happen here in Australia.

If you spend years creating division. constantly vilifying men & blaming the patriarchy for every problem, supporting negative views toward men, you can't expect them to answer your call for support.

The left has failed to connect with male voters, the majority of men feel sidelined and misunderstood. Issues that disproportionately impact men, like the suicide crisis & support for male victims of DV are ignored. 

The sentiment and feelings of the majority of men is that they don't matter.

Equality shouldn‚Äôt feel adversarial, It should bring everyone into the conversation with kindness, listening to genuinely understand‚Äînot just respond.

The woke movement has been catastrophic, it needs to be replaced with real inclusion without the hate.

"You aren‚Äôt missing anything. There‚Äôs an old episode of the Simpsons where principal Skinner has a moment where he was mocked by the kids in his school for something he said or did (can‚Äôt remember exactly what his transgression was.) In his moment of reflection he asks himself ‚Äúcould it be that I‚Äôm so out of touch, I‚Äôm wrong on this issue?‚Äù Then within a few seconds of contemplation, he says ‚Äúno‚Ä¶it‚Äôs the children who are wrong.‚Äù 

This is a perfect representation of the establishment; or as I prefer to call them, the empire. The empire consists of career politicians (on teams red *and* blue) as well as the corporate media (msnbc, cnn, Fox, abc, nbc, cbs, pbs, et al) and Hollywood, and the daytime and late night talk shows, and the music industry and on and on and on and on, ad infinitum. 

The empire has been telling us (us being Americans who have voted team red and/or team blue‚Ä¶Americans who have enjoyed music, movies, etc. for years) that we are wrong, we need more government, we need more control, most of all-*war is good*. Well the empire showed its cards when Trump came down the escalator. They went from suggesting we might be wrong to full on calling us nazi, fascist, racist, (insert root word of your choice)-phobic. They‚Äôve screamed at us and used inflammatory rhetoric while demanding our compliance and allegiance. 

We finally were backed into a corner and we pushed back. We the people voted overwhelmingly for a real estate billionaire from NY who drug the Republican Party along with him. Once elected, the empire resisted him at every turn. He alone couldn‚Äôt accomplish a lot because he faced so much resistance. Four years later, he was defeated in favor of a perfect tool of the empire (Biden.) Biden has been an empire tool for five decades. He is the epitome of politician in that he stands for nothing and simply licks his finger and holds it to the wind to determine his platform. An obvious choice to the bidding of the empire. *Allow me to sit at the big desk and I‚Äôll do whatever you like.* As Biden adopted the platform of the far left that distract us (trans, abortion, etc.) but in reality, adopted the platform of the empire (endless war, empire building, propaganda, etc.) Four years of telling us that it‚Äôs good that men can expose themselves in women‚Äôs locker rooms after beating those women in their sports, sexualizing our children, displaying their sexual proclivities in public, etc., we were once again backed into a corner. Again, we pushed back. 

We the people overwhelmingly voted for the New York billionaire. But the New York billionaire is smart. He went away four years ago and regrouped. He returned with former democrats who have power, wealth, and influence. Elon, Tulsi, RFK, Rogan, Weinstein, Taibi, Pool, Greenwald, on and on. We (not the republicans) the people overwhelmingly defeated their insane ideology. We won the popular vote, the electoral vote, the house, the senate. We showed the insane leftists that we don‚Äôt want to subscribe to their religion. We love women. We love children. We want to protect them and watch them thrive.

"Waiting to see all the leftist gun groups stage the civil disobedience they've been projecting onto the right. Anyone remember the race riots a few years back with BLM? Imagine that but a decent few of them have been 'training'. 

Being real, if it were an actual 2A red blooded American on top of that building, we wouldn't have missed.... the first shot.
Not making light of what happened, but expect a lot of shots with very little efficiency. This is what you should be worried about up until around inauguration.

Furthermore we still have a few months until he's sworn in. They could make Biden senile and reseat him with the VP... making Kamala Potus with or without an election win. A few certain Exec Orders and boom you have Martial Law, extension of Presidential powers and an indefinite postponement of election results. 
Which gets those FEMA camps filled and the country in the direction it has been. 

TLDR: everyone celebrating but we forget about the fact that this person still has a position of power, has already shoehorned her way past her own DNC election and likely has no concern over the actions herein. In fact it only informs them of who their enemies are. Intel scouting.

"(Btw, I‚Äôm not trying to stir anything up or pick a fight with you here or anything like that either, I‚Äôm just having a conversation with you)

I mean, I‚Äôm not concerned or stressed about it either (if anything, I find it highly entertaining lol), but based on how they have handled literally every other situation like this where a Republican wins in anything, assuming that they‚Äôre going to die down or stop talking about this election this time is like the exact opposite of what they‚Äôre going to do. Like, they literally spent four years denying the 2016 election results and made up all sorts of nonsense to try to discredit the outcome.

That sort of behavior is absolutely going to be a staple of the left for the next four years; it‚Äôs going to be all that they talk about for a good while. Just turn the channel over to cnn or msnbc for a minute and see how insanely they are currently reacting to this. 

For example, Morning Joe went on a rant yesterday morning that was literally nothing but 100% lies. He included the ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù hoax, ‚ÄúTrump wants to have Liz Cheney executed‚Äù bs, the ‚Äúliteral dictator‚Äù nonsense‚Äîbasically every single lie you‚Äôve ever heard from the left, including the ones that have been completely and entirely debunked. I‚Äôm literally not exaggerating here; every single thing he said was a blatant lie in every way. Their audience actually believes that shit when he says it, so thinking that those people are going to just give up when they‚Äôve been fed that propaganda and built up these massive non-existent stakes for nearly a decade doesn‚Äôt seem likely to me. 

We know their playbook, and nowhere in that playbook does it say to just accept Trump and shut up about it. A massive swath of them literally think he is going to create a fascist dictatorship in this country, and they 100% believe that. Again, I‚Äôm not exaggerating anything here.

The left has not changed since 2016, so I have no reason to believe that they‚Äôre just gonna drop this election talk all of a sudden. On the contrary, I have every reason to believe that they _will_ keep harping on it and making up lies to cope. It‚Äôs not going to just vanish anytime soon. 

So yeah, I‚Äôm not stressing about it either, but thinking that they‚Äôre gonna quit or die down with the crazy ass rhetoric is assuming they have any semblance of intellectual integrity, which they absolutely don‚Äôt.

"I hear you. Will they ever stop talking about Trump? No. Of course, not. Republicans talked about Biden his whole term, why would we expect the Dems to react differently? I‚Äôm not trying to poke the bear, but I‚Äôve always held the position that it‚Äôs really hard to criticize one party for doing something that both of them do, which is talk. Republicans talk about Trump, Dems talk about Trump, everyone talks about Trump. Both sides pass lies around like Thanksgiving dinner. It‚Äôs the nature of politics. That is particularly why I do not see them talking as something to harp on. 

I actually have seen lots of journalists talk about the failure of the Dem party, though. You and I may have been looking at different sections of media but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone deny the results of any sort. Some blame-shifting for sure, but you know there will always be people who lie in media. You should always control for that when watching anything, anyway. That‚Äôs kind of something we can‚Äôt do much about.

Trump is a provocative figure, let‚Äôs be honest. At least the sensible individuals here can admit to that. Like him all you want, but he isn‚Äôt popular just because of his politics. He aggravates the atmosphere that politicians have maintained for decades. He‚Äôs a charismatic leader who has a loyal following which encourages him to remain steadfast. To expect anyone to stop talking about him is, at the very least, unrealistic. Now, will we have another Jan 6th? No, because that‚Äôs nonsense. Like I said, the most Dems can do is talk about it all day, which they‚Äôre at liberty to do. Just like Republicans are at liberty to call Joe Biden old and Kamala Harris a ‚Äúwitch.‚Äù Also understand that they‚Äôre in shock at how massively the Dem party failed, even more so than they did in 2016. This is feeling more like the 5 stages of grief. I get that you‚Äôre annoyed by it, but Republicans went through it in 2020. This is nothing new. The only difference is Dems will take up space on social media for the next four years until they get a chance at office again, but it‚Äôs highly unlikely any physical opposition will take place. This is a red wave election. Trump has more power than he did in 2016. So the most Dems CAN do is talk, lol.",2024-11-07 14:06:04,negative,0.6516,0.6516,0.315,0.0334,r/Republican

There's no way I would've voted for someone so inept and incompetent, and who only got where she is bc of gender and race (and sleeping her way to the top).

I also couldn't vote for someone whose name literally means ""horrible"" in Finnish. Oh, and the cackling didn't help.

I voted for Trump bc:

1 He cares about the USA border, will deport the bad people who've snuck across,  and will start securing it - again.

2 He will protect women's spaces, the safety of Jewish students on college campuses, and the rights of Asian American college students who have been kept out of universities due to racism by bigoted policies.

3 He will stand up to Islamic terrorism and help protect Israel.

I did not vote for Kamala bc:

1 She cared only about the borders of other countries, would continue to ignore criminals sneaking into the USA to committ crimes, and would make it easier than ever for anyone to illegally enter the USA.

2 She would kowtow to men who insist on invading women's spaces, continue to ignore the safety of Jewish students at US college campuses, and ignore the decades of racial discrimination against Asians at US Universities.

3 She would pretend Islamic terrorists are trustworthy and undermine the safety of Israel by pushing them to make a peace agreement with shose who want to push Israel and Jews into the sea.

"Donald Trump might pull this off. It‚Äôs too early to say; we might not know till the middle of next year, or whenever some¬†[antediluvian state finishes counting by hand](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-presidential-election-2024-when-dates-candidates-voting/). Plus Electoral College madness means that Trump could surge in the popular vote yet still lose via Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (the reverse Hillary). But consider the following:

First, he took¬†[Florida easily, including Miami-Dade](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-election-latest-news-polling-trump-kamala/). Joe Biden won that county in 2020; Hillary Clinton swept it by nearly 30 points in 2016. What‚Äôs made the difference? Trump‚Äôs doing well among Latino voters, presumably men.

Second, there are hints he‚Äôs gained ground among the affluent in Virginia, which is supposed to be a lock for Kamala; Wasps with degrees are her people.

Third, he seems to be scooping Georgia, which might have been competitive and certainly suggests the sun-belt is safe (Texas is also not in play). Fourth, an NBC exit poll gives him a six point advantage among independents in the critical state of Pennsylvania.

Exit polls generally indicate that¬†[‚Äúthe future of democracy‚Äù is a leading issue,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/americans-voting-out-of-resentment-and-fear/)¬†which breathless TV commentators assumed was a good sign for Harris. But lots of Republicans think the Democrats stole the election in 2020, so they might be recording concern for that issue as well.

The other major matter is the economy, and Trump polls stronger than Kamala on that one for obvious reasons (ie inflation). No wonder election betting seems to slightly favour Republicans, along with the¬†*New York Times*¬†and Decision Desk HQ.

But, yes, there‚Äôs a long night ahead, and none of us knows anything for sure. It‚Äôs a delight to watch British TV presenters disclose the latest thing they read on CNN as if it were a personal insight (‚ÄùI‚Äôm predicting now that Harris will take Vermont and the Pope will carry the Vatican‚Äù).

But what we can decisively say at this juncture is that of the four options ‚Äì Trump easy win, narrow win; Harris narrow win, easy win ‚Äì the Harris easy win is off the table. Despite January 6, a rape trial, ‚Äúeating the pets‚Äù and a comedian calling Puerto Rico a ‚Äúfloating island of garbage‚Äù. I wonder if Joe Biden might have done better?

"Good Dad indeed. 

It's sad though that the far left 8 year disinformation campaign has essentially intimidated people into not openly stating they're for Trump.

The left Progressive disinformation campaign was successful enough to prevent a conversation between a Father/Daughter from being open about it with each other until election day. 

That's not a knock at all on the OP. That has become ""normal"" for millions, including myself. A lot of people were manipulated into feeling ashamed for supporting Trump 8 years ago.

I'm happy that the conversation was eventually had with OP and Dad.

We can't let the mainstream media dictate our conversations with FAMILY!!! Or for that matter.... friends and family, or anyone else.

It's a Liberal tactic to scare people into not using their 1st amendment rights!
