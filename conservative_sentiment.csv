"As a Marine veteran myself I find it absolutely abhorrent what they have done.  The way to be prepared for the future is to gain new capabilities, or at least don’t get rid of the ones you have.

Governor Shapiro said it doesn't matter what they do because they're going to get sued either way. The lawyers are saying there are multiple other lawsuits going on in different counties, so the situation remains unresolved by the courts in their eyes, and the ballots can still be counted.

>In a statement after the state Supreme Court ruling, Mr. Shapiro said he believed all eligible votes should be counted in every race. He said local officials were left with a lack of clarity: “damned if they did and damned if they didn’t” count undated votes, “likely facing legal action no matter which decision they made.”

Like it or not, Pelosi still holds immense political sway, influence and connections. Democrats that complain about her are small fry and have nowhere near the experience she has. Her wholehearted endorsement for Biden's second term was a vote of confidence and when she said he needed to step down he was gone within a week or so.

Much like Trump, at her age, she's as sharp as ever and continues to win support amongst her constituents. She was just re-elected to her house seat and she intends to run again in 2 years as she's already filed the paperwork for it.

Is she to blame for the 1 billion+ for electoral collapse? No. She's right, it's on biden. Had he stepped down sooner from the campaign, the Democrat Party could have chosen a more viable candidate with a real primary. However, she is one of the pillars of the Democrat Party and did help to prop up Biden's campaign until he turned into political poison, but she's not the only one. Hundreds of democrat politicians supported Biden--where's their accountability? 

Frankly, the loss of the election for the Democrats has more to do with Democrat leadership and politicians being tone deaf and alienating their voter base.

"Not happening. First of all, there’s been calls for this in the past but it never got anywhere.

Secondly, anyone who doesn’t do it immediately benefits from capital flight. 

Thirdly, huge wealth taxes always stifle growth. Lots of countries have done these but it usually find within a decade that they are terrible ideas. Norway is in the course of discovering that. Spain has them but old Spanish families have structures to complete avoid it. Switzerland has one but it’s tiny.

The problems with them are:

1) enforcement is hard and those subject to it have extensive legal methods to mitigate. Families deploy legions of bankers and accountants to get values lower while the government must do the same: 

2) they divert capital from the people best at investing (rich with growing fortunes) to those worst at it (the government)

4) they tend to be inflationary on the margins in that they swap out high efficiency investment for consumption 

5) they ultimately due to the above generate not a ton of revenue but slow growth.

A lot of this stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what wealth is. Liberals think you can move an asset dollar into a consumed dollar at vast scale with no issues, that there’s some pot of money and it’s zero sum. You can’t deplete investment dollars into consumption dollars without problems. Britain did a more extreme version of this in the post ww2 era and wrecked their economy in the 70s, paving the way for a conservative sweep under thatcher in the 80s, followed by a lot of prosperity.  It was an 83% income tax with a 15% investment surcharge, so investments became massive negative return net of inflation. Similar effects to a wealth tax. 

The most effective taxes in terms of protecting growth while generating  income for the government are taxes on ‘economic rents’ which most obviously are property taxes but could be things like taxes on entities collecting monopoly-like rents without innovation (and hilariously, we let our local hospitals be non profits even though they are the closest candidate other than utilities) . Next best is sales taxes and similar, followed by income, followed by corporate taxes and capital gains taxes. In general, taxes that encourage investment and activity are going to be more growth than taxes that punish investment and activity. Put another way, more supply almost always helps, more demand has trade-offs, and optimal tax policy generally follows that contour.

The only reason to flip that order is if ‘inequality’ is your main policy goal, but I’d argue that every time we’ve drastically increased inequality without non-innovating monopolies, we’ve also increased everyone else’s standard of living… punishing the rich severely ends up punishing everyone else 10 years later… hence very few wealth taxes on paper currently. 

In my opinion the single largest tax policy error we made as a country is over reliance on personal income tax instead of having a baseline national property tax and/or sales tax for these reasons, but we can’t easily change that now.

This shitty wealth tax idea ultimately is more garbage South American socialist policy of the sort that they keep trying over and over, and look where that’s got that continent except Chile which has been more moderate. Maybe Argentina will persevere with their new conservative economics and show them the way..",2024-11-18 16:36:22,negative,0.5158,0.5158,0.4006,0.0836,r/conservative

Reddit then restricted my sub the next day and have kept it restricted since.  They have since gone on to restrict several other up and coming subs that were allowing right wing views.

Reddit allows the subs to still exists, they just take the sub out of the promotion algorithm so no one sees any content that gets posted there effectively killing the subs growth and keeping it hidden on the platform.  I asked admins about this and they confirmed that they did that to my sub.  They have been very vague about why they did it though.....All of my questions for help on fixing whatever issues they have get ignored and now they just completely ignore me when I ask them questions.

I asked the admins a few times about if they think a sub is so bad that they don't want it promoted and seen by users, then why not ban it if they think it is that bad.  They never bothered to respond.

"Here’s the thing - we are unified in wanting a conservative agenda, but that’s not just a tent of people who support Trump in all cases no matter what. A lot of the party agrees 90% of the time but not 100%, and you don’t get to majority control typically with 100% agreement. This is not a 70 Republican senator senate. It’s a 53 senator senate. Figuring out the contours of those disagreement and how they’ll be navigated is part of this process that happens in confirmations. 

Also, the senate isn’t going to want to give up the power they’ve had forever, and moreover, our system of government isn’t imperial, it’s party based, and cabinet approval is part of the constitution. 

McConnell didn’t say the senate was going to block a lot of nominees, but is saying they will approve them, and yeah, a few are going to either be pushed back on from the start, or give such embarrassing answers that they’ll save Trump from a good initial decision that would’ve been a disaster later.  You can’t expect every pick made at this rate to end up awesome. And some of those will still make it through with a back room agreement on boundaries.

"He’s an independent thinker and a legit scientist. This is a good choice that pleases multiple constituencies. Group think is definitely a problem in the NIH, but he will elevate the problem solving instead of just overwriting it with some other group think.

If we are going to beat cancer and Alzheimer’s in the next decade, it’s going to be likely with NIH funded stuff…

To me NIH needs a lot of reform but not revolution so it’s good to get someone in who understands the strengths but also the problems and knows where deep change can be done and also what should be preserved.

One topic not discussed much is funding trials of off patent or non pharmacological stuff. That often is a total waste of money but sometimes there are good ideas, but pharma doesn’t want to fund it because no upside. Dose reduction trials are another - no incentive for pharma, but lots for patients. As an example for multiple myeloma, a patient had the idea of trying to reduce steroid dosing because it was miserable and somehow the funding was cobbled together and it turned out half the dose was just as effective. There’s probably a lot more of that kind of stuff.

"A lot of people commenting on here with absolutely zero clue on how the federal government works. Elon and Vivek are equally as ignorant the more I hear them talk about the federal workforce. Many of the high skill positions (finance, engineers, scientists, acquisitions, PM, etc) can make much more money in the private sector and only stay in govt because of the incentives like remote work among other things. People complain that employees are being paid six figures to work from home but conveniently ignore that they could go to the industry side and make 50%-100% more in their respective career field. A lot of information is being manipulated to sway public perception. For example, we save a TON of money on contractor employees that can be remote instead of requiring them to live in high cost areas like DC. 


If they take these incentives away many of the high performing employees are going to move to the private sector leaving the govt with the duds who don't mind sitting in traffic for three hours every day. 


If ppl want the govt to be more efficient they should be supporting flexibilities to retain the high performers to decrease the chance of losing them to the private sector. As someone who used to work in the federal govt, I fear DOGE is going to do the exact opposite of their intended goal if they continue to go down this path with the workforce.

"I'm not saying an agency doesn't have the authority to reassign an employee from one area to another. That's a bit of a straw man because that's not what Vivek is talking about. Vivek is claiming they're going to shut down entire departments, which to my point, isn't possible without going through congress. Each agency can manage themselves however they want as long as they're fulfilling their mission. Making all the FBI agents sweep floors instead of providing law enforcement would be against the intent of the congressional establishment of the FBI. 


And just because part of an agency may be operating outside it's scope, doesn't give the executive the authority to shut down the entire agency.  


I guess if you want to believe the false bill of goods that Elon and Vivek are selling you, that is your prerogative. But I was a fed for 20 years and can tell you that a lot of their plans with the federal workforce will not come to fruition. For as smart as they are, neither of them know what they're talking about and are going to disappoint a lot of people on the right.

My concern is that *it is* either that bad, or that the perception of a lot of people (not the majority by any means), is off.
I completely get wanting change, I want it too; but we also already had trump and he was terrible in a bunch of other ways.

My fear is that he doesn't have any experience with actually making change, and a bunch of his cronies are going to use that to enrich themselves at the expense of the rest of us.

Plus, for change, it usually comes from the younger generation. A huge part of the problem is 90% of the house and Senate, and now president are between 65-90 years old.

If you want help with your computer, your phone, or anything technological, intricate, or new, you don't ask your grandfather about it, you talk to your niece or nephew.

Throw in the willingness to commit crimes, even if you don't think he's guilty of some, it's obvious he's not a stranger to the idea, and frankly I want the people in the government held to a higher standard.

"1. Yes, but more trump appointed judges were around in 2020 than 2024, some even heard the fraud cases and dismissed them for various reasons, primarily because trump didn't have legal standing or evidentiary support for his claims.
2a. I'm aware, and that's a better argument for why 2020 wasn't stolen. For it to be stolen, a widespread effort through multiple districts would have to exist, leaving no trace of it. Plenty of position turnover happened, but it's unlikely the officials under trump would have been able to be instilled by democrats to steal an election, and none lost their jobs because of impropriety or wrongdoing.
2b. She took over mid campaign for a candidate, giving her less time to campaign and being tied to a presidency with a low approval rating, add a dash of racism and sexism (I'm not saying all votes against her were this, but they are factors that exist) and the outcome wasn't a big surprise. Also, you're ignoring the totals. If 20 million votes were fraud in 2020, 2024 should have had results closer to 2016, it didn't. So why are the numbers closer to the supposedly bogus election than the one prior, unless the numbers make sense.

"This should have happened a long time ago. It greatly increases the cost of the war for Russia. Had this been done 2 years ago they might have a peace deal already, and that would in turn relieve a lot of food inflation as Ukraine came online fully for their various grain crops. The idea that we’d give Ukraine some cutting edge stuff Russia lacks counters to, then tie it off with kid gloves that allow Russia to just move depots back a few miles more is bizarre. 

A common thread in U.S.-Russian relations is Russian leaders assess our presidents as men, and if they think they are weak, push. When presented evidence to the contrary, they make deals. See Cuban missile crisis - started when they thought Kennedy was a pansy because of his terrible decision making in bay of pigs and also an in person meeting where he didn’t seem confident, ended when he stopped acting weak. This may be no different. We let them get inside our head (or Biden’s handlers heads) on myriad red lines none of which have mattered. Putin sees weakness so he keeps going. 

It’s maybe not the most popular opinion on the right these days, but despite the naysayers like sacks, we’ve dramatically scaled artillery production domestically way ahead of schedule, and it keeps speeding up. When Ukraine is flush with relatively cheap anti air missiles and artillery shells, Russia makes no progress and Ukraine does. When they aren’t, Russia outshoots them and makes progress. The war can be simplified almost to those terms. Deep strike missiles disrupt  Russian supply chain of artillery shells severely denying them this advantage. In any case we need to wrap this up and focus on other problems.

Maybe it's a marketing problem, maybe no amount of money is enough to reach the desired goal.  Maybe Russia pulls out tomorrow; I'm sure the left would bend over backwards to deny Trump any credit. Regardless, it is a real problem that needs to be resolved eventually.

And the problem is more than financial; Russia has no issue with destroying whatever they want, and has the means to do it on a large scale.  Being able to deliver equipment by road and rail gives them a huge advantage that overshadows any fiscal outlays from their opponents.  Hundreds of thousands are killed every year while cities and towns are left in ruins.  There's an unknown time limit on this thing, even if an unlimited supply of money and arms was available.

"In case anyone wants to know why this is a serious escalation, this isn't just giving them missiles with further range than before. These missiles can only be guided by US military satellites and controlled from US military with coordinates input by US Military. These are not assets than can be controlled by Ukraine. So, this means that actual US intelligence and soldiers will need to be doing all of the controlling, targeting, and guiding of the missiles to their targets. So, let's say you have a missile strike far into Russia, let's say even a city like Moscow. The only way that would be possible was because the USA literally did everything but pick the target.

The problem here though is that the US Intelligence is basically working overtime providing targets to Ukraine, so any target Ukraine has for attack is almost assuredly thanks to Big Brother USA who has all the satellites and intelligence to give them the targets. This is no different than the USA launching missiles into Russia at this point. This is the absolute biggest escalation of the war so far, and there is no ""Oh, Ukraine is picking the targets. We didn't do this"" excuses anymore.

One area Elon will understand that is totally broken is federal IT contracts. So much waste, they pay NSA type prices for middle of no where ISP quality. It’s crazy. Or course that’s a tiny drop in the bucket compared to military requisitions. 

I do know the republicans want to clean up performance management though which will help a lot, assuming you have various appointed heads who want to trim fat.

Another thing of importance - if you just cut budgets across the board without changing rules, all the contractors get cut to make budget because you can’t really fire employees, then productive employees quit because it is ineffective to work without some of the more effective contractors, and you get left with useless employees. Imagine doing that to for example a local fbi office that’s busting gangs or dirty doctors, or a social security office enrolling people in benefits and taking dead people off.

Contractors are the ones actually keeping the lights on, whereas actual government employees are often mostly useless besides filling out bureaucratic paperwork.

That said, there’s a lot of corruption in how contracts are awarded. Just look at the fiasco that was Obama’s Healthcare.gov website. Reducing corruption in the procurement process would no doubt save a ton of money. Also, hiring more talent in-house could save money, since you cut out the middleman, but as you point out, you’d need a more flexible hiring system for government employees.

None of those are easy problems to fix, because it would require fundamental changes in how government operates. And it’s doubtful you can ever get efficiency comparable to a private business, without capitalist pressure.

That said, I would argue that even studying the correlation between obesity and African Americans is misguided. There’s plenty of obesity in poor White people. The more significant correlation is between economic class and diet. 

People from poorer economic classes in America eat poorly. Sometimes that carries over a generation or two, as bad habits don’t automatically disappear the moment you move to a nicer neighborhood.

Even for supermarkets of the same chain, if you go to one in a poor neighborhood, you will see mostly junk food. In a rich neighborhood, it will be mostly fancy organic stuff. So the issue is very clearly one of economics.

This country is too obsessed with making everything a race issue.

"**From The Telegraph:**

Democrats spent $14,974.31 on food deliveries from Uber Eats and DoorDash from July onwards, according to the Federal Election Commission.

Details of the Harris campaign’s spending decisions come amid party recriminations following the [Democrats’ decisive election defeat on Nov 5](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us-election/presidential-election-2024-harris-trump-latest-results/).

“We didn’t emphasise the economy,” Ro Khanna, a California Congressman, told The Washington Post on Saturday. “Instead, we spent a billion dollars having concerts all over America. I mean, it was ridiculous.”

Filings show the campaign also shelled out $8,929.12 on ice cream pints and parlours such as Sweet Lucy’s Ice Cream and Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams after [Joe Biden dropped out of the race](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/07/21/joe-biden-statement-in-full-president-democrats/).

A further $6,000-“site fee” was paid to the Arizona board game cafe Snakes and Lattes for a Tim Walz visit.

Democrats also forked out a further $2.6 million on private jet travel in the final days of the campaign as part of a blitz of the battleground states.

As Ms Harris criss-crossed the nation between Oct 1 – Oct 17, her campaign spent nearly $2.2 million on south Florida-based firm Private Jet Services Group and a further $430,000 on Advanced Aviation Team in Virginia, the New York Post reported.

The late flurry of flights brought Ms Harris’s total spend on private jets to $12 million, the outlet reported.

The use of private jets, which can be up to 14 times more polluting than commercial flights, clashes with her calls on the campaign trail to cut back on carbon emissions.

Ms Harris has previously called climate change an “existential threat”, drawing a stark contrast with [Mr Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” policy on fossil fuels](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/11/11/ftse-100-markets-latest-uk-news-us-trump-bitcoin-pound/).

"**From The Telegraph:** 

[Robert F Kennedy Jr](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/robert-f-kennedy-jr-us-health-secretary-trump-vaccines/) was pictured eating McDonald’s on Donald Trump’s private plane as they made their way to watch the UFC in New York on Saturday night.

RFK Jr, who Mr Trump has tapped as [America’s next health secretary](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/15/democrat-trump-ally-robert-f-kennedy-america/), struck an awkward pose as he sat with his McDonald’s burger, fries and Coca Cola – the president-elect’s favourite meal.

He was joined by Elon Musk as Mr Trump was given a hero’s welcome during his first appearance at the UFC since [winning the election earlier this month](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/donald-trump-showing-early-signs-of-winning-election/).

RFK Jr was highly critical of the modern diet during the election campaign, vowing to ‘Make America Healthy Again’, and even described Mr Trump’s diet as “really bad”.

“Campaign food is always bad, but the food that goes onto \[Trump Force One\] is, like, just poison,” the 70-year-old told podcaster Joe Polish on Monday.

“You have a choice between – you don’t have the choice, you’re either given KFC or Big Macs. That’s when you’re lucky, and then the rest of the stuff I consider kind of inedible.”

RFK Jr was particularly critical of [McDonald’s](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/21/donald-trump-kamala-harris-mcdonalds-us-election/) during the election campaign.

After Mr Trump made an iconic appearance at McDonald’s during the campaign last month, RFK Jr said the fast food chain should be cooked in beef fat rather than seed oils.

“That was good for you. Your body needs that, it makes you healthy,” Mr Kennedy said on Fox News. “Why aren’t we making it with tallow fat again?”

But he denied wanting to ban fast food, saying it is “part of American culture”.

Mr Trump’s appearance at Madison Square Garden, where he held [one of his last rallies](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/27/donald-trump-holds-rally-at-madison-square-garden-new-york/) of the election campaign, was met with scenes of jubilation by fans and fighters alike.

Jon Jones, widely considered to be the greatest UFC fighter of all time, paid tribute to the president-elect seconds after retaining his champion status by performing [the Republican’s trademark dance](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/the-seven-best-clips-of-politicians-dad-dancing/) and handing Mr Trump his heavyweight belt.

Jones also thanked Mr Trump during his victory interview with Joe Rogan before launching a “USA” chant, which was met with cheers and applause in the crowd.

The science for margin of error is very clear. For the population of Iowa it’s simply a plug in to the formula, and to get MOE of 2% you need to sample 2,400+ people. That’s it. To get 15% margin of error like she did you only interview 40+ people, which she didn’t do.

She is an experienced pollster so it’s improbable that the poll is badly made. It’s impossible that she didn’t know how to sample the population correctly. She got A+ grade - she knew how to do it.

Bottom line - it was not a fluke. It is not a statistical mistake. A miss of 2% is acceptable in statistic - even 5% is still “good” but 16 points is just too much. Even Nate Silver stated that she will be proven wrong.",2024-11-17 15:48:03,negative,0.4898,0.4898,0.4239,0.0863,r/conservative

"Lot of discussion in this thread about the cost of childbearing and rearing. How overall economic ills are dissuading people from having kids. Some blame placed on abortions and birth control. Most of that is shit. We have created social norms in the name of 'safety' that has systematically broken all of the pre-internet ways to meet a future spouse, sapped men of all agency to fulfill their evolutionary role as suitors in the internet dating era, combined with a lot of Americas unmarried are leading lives that unintentionally preclude themselves from marriage.

I'd love to get married and have kids. To that end I've been using hinge and tinder for the last two years with intent and literally have not gotten a single match that wasn't an OF hoe or someone with serious personal issues. Beyond that the rest of the profiles I see are landwhales, expect something ridiculous like polyamory, or simply rage quits when they realize I'm right of Marx. I genuinely cannot remember ever going on a good date from the apps.

Last time I tried to go oldschool and approach a woman in public (at a concert) she rejected me out of hand with 'if you want to meet someone get Bumble'. Not the first time I was told to fuck off, but never was the reason so clearly articulated that it's just socially unacceptable now.

My dad met my mom at work. She rejected him multiple times, but he persisted for weeks apparently, up to and including leaving love poems on her car and bringing her flowers repeatedly. In this day and age approaching a female coworker is career suicide. Instant firing, and you're not getting a reference, and may get blackballed. Let alone if you pulled the shit my dad did you'd end up arrested these days.

Other one you always hear is getting set up on a date by a friend. Last time that happened for me was years ago now, and it went well for a couple weeks till she assaulted me out of nowhere in public. Found out awhile later she had no recollection of the incident and had apparently been checked into rehab by her parents cause she got fired for drinking on the job.

My sister tried to set me up with one of her former coworkers last year. I thought it was going well till I brought up that I wanted kids, she said she absolutely does not, ended the date early, and never answered a text again. Found out she literally moved to Australia a couple months later and just deleted her number at that point.

I've looked into IRL singles shit, but its all analog tinder nonsense like speed dating or ""match making"" services that reeks of being a grift.

As a straight guy obviously I am speaking from my perspective, but I know single men are just as guilty of promulgating the cultural rot that has led us here but I can't speak to women's perspective. From my view, our culture has become completely hostile to forming heterosexual relationships to the point that you're pathologized as a creep for acting the suitor, or worse branded a deviant who sexually harasses women. This has utterly destroyed how relationships has been formed in our society for a few hundred years, to be replaced by online dating. Services that have zero incentive to actually form lasting relationships because that literally destroys their user base. Oh and their seeming utter inability to keep pornographers off their platforms means half your feed is smut peddling bots. Beyond that these apps have removed all agency for men to actually perservere as a suitor, so if you give one 'ick' feeling that door is forever closed. So what am I supposed to do?

"Are you religious at all? That could help. 

I met my husband on Facebook dating (I know) but since we are both religious and were both active in the local religious scene, we had a bunch of friends in common which fb dating showed us. I think that created a bit of trust or at least social collateral. Plus a shared social network which was a bit better than being complete strangers. 

It turned out we were both also on one of the Catholic dating sites but he just never really checked it lol so he didn’t see me ping him there. I was able to limit my FB dating preferences to men who shared my same religion (Catholic) or at least were broadly Christian, and made it pretty clear in my bio that I wasn’t interested in anything casual. Idk if FB dating even still exists or if it still has that function but it helped weed out a lot of unsuitable matches. I still had tons of matches and went on several other dates before meeting my husband. It was obvious to me that men are definitely out there looking for real connection, and are having a hard time finding it. I was living in a deep blue area (DC) so that certainly wasn’t making things easy for anyone looking for anything more than casual hookups either. One of the guys I talked to / went on a couple dates with later found someone more suited to him and got married around the same time I did, which was nice to see as it served as an example that these guys were not all lip service.

As for the claim that Casey is trying to get unregistered voters counted, that’s not what this article actually says. There are ballots that are being contested that the board needs to review to determine if they are eligible. That seems fair to me as well.

If I take out a loan for $1m, that means I'm still going to have to generate $1m (plus interest) in income over the term of the loan. Now, let's say as a best case scenario for the borrower, I manage to never intend to repay the loan but instead constantly refinance and only make required payments. Let's also assume that I manage to generate the income to make these payments in a way that I don't have to pay income tax on, which would be increasingly difficult the higher the sum of the loan. Again, even for best case scenario for me as the borrower, that money still gets passed to the lender, who now has to claim that money as income, which is taxed.

"I think states could tax sales only and be fine, it would also be a decent measure of local economic success and the government could reasonably gauge if their policy is hurting or helping. I strongly believe that having a simple one tax rate for all is the best option as that absolutely guts the need for a multimillion dollar agency like the irs. Theres always going to be tax crime so you can't out right get rid of them but there will be less dependency on things like h&r block and the irs. One thing I didn't think about before though is the tax on items like cigarettes or alcohol that some places do to discourage growth. I think thats wrong on some level but it is better than an out right ban of those items too. Either way the system could be simple and could make it so everyone pays their part.

It's generally considered that both candidates will support Israel no matter what they do, and you should see the things they show Israel doing in the Muslim news feeds. They voted for Trump because of three reasons mainly, the economy, immigration, and LGBT. 

It was a heated debate in my community. Many said that we shouldn't support any candidate that would support Israel. The issue with supporting Israel is usually more about the settlements than anything. They show us in the news Israeli settlers pouring concrete in Muslim wells to make them move. They show them forcing people out of their houses so they can move in. They show them burning Muslim crops to make them bankrupt. However, many Muslims just figured nothing they can do will stop Israel from annexing the Palestinian territories if only they could get rid of the people.

I personally wouldn’t want to risk it, because the Senate is often the last set of brakes for liberal excesses in this country. Especially with the filibuster. Adding a few new Democrat-leaning Senate seats increase the chances of them getting filibuster-proof super majorities in the Senate.

Kamala is perhaps the most fake, disingenuous person in US politics. Practically her entire career has been a sham.

To her flameout as a presidential candidate only to be plucked off the trash heap by Joe because she’s a black woman. Then spent the bulk majority of her VP tenure playing computer solitaire if the Secret Service rumors are true. All while being the type of toxic leader who loves to take credit and blame others.

"It's an ugly business, debt reduction,....and it's unlikely to occur. It means pain and even Republicans are averse to inflicting pain on voters.

The best hope - a slim one - is that spending can be reduced to the point where GDP grows faster than the debt....thereby reducing the debt not in actual terms, but as a percentage of GDP.

We sell T-bills to investors to finance the debt, and when they mature, we sell T-bills to *new* investors to pay off the old ones. This is literally the classic definition of a Ponzi scheme.

When one examines all the existential threats to the Republic, ever accruing debt and eventual insolvency is the most certain and linear. We're supposed to love our children and grand-children.....but instead, we're passing on to them an inheritance of unserviceable debt so that *we* could live comfortably, beyond our means.

"The most effective fix would be to invoke the odious debt doctrine by renouncing all federal debt contracted by the Biden-Harris regime. The rationale is that the previous government was not fully legitimate due to irregularities during the 2020 election.

Invoking the odious debt doctrine has the advantage of encouraging the financial interests which buy treasuries to oppose fraud-the-vote initiatives going forward. It is sort of a compromise between a full default, which is where the federal government has been heading towards, and massively raising taxes while simultaneously cutting spending to pay off the debt. It is also more fair to elderly and impoverished people than using inflation (implicit default), which is what has previously been pursued to an extent by the federal government.

The odious debt doctrine is an established legal principle…

Gaetz' selection as head of the DOJ becomes much clearer after you read this. It's from Marc Caputo, employed by the Never Trumpians of The Bulwark.

The tl;dr is that a rich douche that was friends with Gaetz Jr. got popped for trafficking a minor as well as a bunch of other heinous shit. *Somehow* an Israeli consulate guy had inside knowledge of a scheme to blackmail Gaetz Sr. into funding 25 million dollars towards a plan to free a CIA asset being held in Iran. Thus ties into another scheme between the FBI and a Russian Oligarch to free *another* asset hostage during the whole RussiaGate shit.

What's the point of having states at all then if anything can just be overridden by the federal government? In my opinion the federal government clearly does not have this legal authority.

"I realized after I typed my message that more than likely you are Turkish. Makes sense now. I won't lie to you, there is definitely an anti-Turkish sentiment for sure. I lived in Northern Greece, about an hour away from Thessaloniki. We had a lot of tourists, Russians, Germans, Ukrainians, Bulgarians but I never met a Turk growing up. I remember watching riots on TV in Cyprus and seeing a man get shot by a Turkish officer in the head. He tried climbing up a pole to remove the Turkish flag, he died holding a Greek flag in his hands, covered in blood. That stayed with me to this day

Now at the same time, Greeks from where I lived would go to Turkey to buy things that we wouldn't have in Greece. Also to buy cheaper product and sell in Greece lol, hustling. So there is an economic factor too. If you came to my village where I grew up, you'd be ok. As a tourist we need you and we thrive on tourism.  Living in America, I'm not as hardline as I would've been on Turkey had I stayed in Greece. Like everything, the average person is likely to treat you well but there are elements of the collective. Greeks are fiercely nationalistic and being under Ottoman rule for 400 years, trust me in school they don't let us forget. 

All in all, I don't think you'd be assaulted or anything like that. Where I lived it's a quiet life with lots of activities come tourist season. Maybe one day we'll share a drink in Greece. Btw we refer to it as Constantinople to this day, some things don't change.

Hope you're well, in the end we're both Americans and politically aligned as well. You seem fine to me then 😉.

Same thing in Türkiye. My aunt and uncle live outside of Demre. They own a B&B. They said it’s mostly Russians, Brit’s and Greeks but it is a small village so it would be nice to visit but not suitable for long term stay with small kids. 

Honestly I stick out like a sore thumb in Türkiye. My husband had so much fun when we visit but I constantly get berated by Turks for not being Turk enough.

If a child is deemed to have something, there should be a follow up secondary evaluation by a separate physician.

Right now we have this strange thing going on where somehow too many kids are misdiagnosed with a mental disorder, while missing millions of kids who actually do have one.

There were very strict rules for those players that were not vaxed.   That is an individual decision and NOBODY or any ORGANIZATION has the right to coerce you which is WHY you are now seeing huge lawsuits being won against employers due to the inappropriate pressure.  Legally, an employer has to offer you a medical or religious exemption.   They should play football and leave the politics out of it.

This is an article from 2021 a year after C0vid.  Towards the very bottom here is what they said about non vaxed players and strict policies:  While the NFL has made stricter rules and harsher penalties for players who are unvaccinated, the league has not required players to be vaccinated.   That is  very discriminatory. Treating one set of players differently with different rules than the other set.

And yes... there are actually questions about what happened to arms shipments to Ukraine.

And please note... those links... they're official .gov links... meaning they're not some media-created lies... they're legitimate and official US government approved.

To your additional questions...

1. China ain't going to invade Tawain.  China, unlike, well us, gave up ambitions of military conquest back in the seventies when they fought Vietnam.  China wants to become the economic hegemony in Asia... not the military hegemony.  China will absolutely try to impose economic hardships on Taiwan... but its not going to attempt a D-Day landing anytime soon.
2. Russia invading Belarus matters to me about as much as Iran invading Iraq.  Not our problem... and before it comes up, were Russia to invade a NATO nation, that would be our problem.  But that is even more unlikely... Putin wants power, and he knows if he invades a NATO nation defended by American nuclear weapons all he will end up with is a glass parking lot to rule over.
3. Venezuela invading a neighbor matters to me as much as Iran invading Iraq.  Hell, it matters even less to me than Russia invading Belarus because Venezuela is even less of a threat to us than Russia is.
4. Yes actually, 1930's populist isolation doesn't sound that bad.  Twenty years ago when I was full of piss and vinegar and had no real concept of a life well spent I had a different opinion.  But now, after we've literally spent the past twenty years actively engaged in a war and are now engaged in a proxy war...  Yeah... I'd rather my children not have to endure the hardships my generation has had to endure because some fossils from the Reagan-era are disappointed that they never got their Dr. Strangelove showdown with the USSR.

***The only people, on the right at least, pushing us towards war right now are the Reaganites who were too young to go to Vietnam, but too old to go to Afghanistan and don't know what war really is... none of you can be trusted to make wise decisions on any subject that may result in any of our children dying on foreign soil.***

Now for the part you probably won't appreciate... you presumed that Ukraine is pure as the driven snow, that much is obvious given your statements about biolabs and arms shipments.  But... given that I easily, with one quick google search, showed that your presumption was based on, let's be kind and say, faulty beliefs... I feel confident in stating that all your others beliefs, including your dismissal of populist isolationism, are equally faulty.

Democrats are attacking the religious faith of several of President-elect Donald Trump’s nominees for senior positions, risking a confrontation with the Constitution, which prohibits the use of religious tests for public office.

Pete Hegseth, who is Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Defense, has been criticized for his tattoos, one of which features a Jerusalem cross. Another includes a Crusader motto that, critics say, has been appropriated by far-right groups.

Meanwhile, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, who has been nominated to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Israel, has been criticized by Democratic Senators specifically for his religious views about the Jews’ right to the Land of Israel.

"# Cry HARDER Dems ! ! !

Democrats are attacking the religious faith of several of President-elect Donald Trump’s nominees for senior positions, risking a confrontation with the Constitution, which prohibits the use of religious tests for public office.

Pete Hegseth, who is Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Defense, has been criticized for his tattoos, one of which features a Jerusalem cross. Another includes a Crusader motto that, critics say, has been appropriated by far-right groups.

Meanwhile, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, who has been nominated to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Israel, has been criticized by Democratic Senators specifically for his religious views about the Jews’ right to the Land of Israel.

"I'd say you're probably correct that this is just larping... But that could also just be normalcy bias.

Let's not forget that there are countless instances around the world and throughout history, including our own country, where the minority party does this and they aren't just larping.

So long as they continue to recognize the statutory power of the executive branch and act within the bounds of the law (e.g. continue to recognize the legitimate and lawful authority of Trump) this is just an exercise in virtue signalling and won't be anything more than a minor annoyance.

But, again, let's not discount the possibility, however small, that they will refuse to recognize the legitimate statutory power of an executive branch headed up by Trump... In which case this becomes something far more worrisome and impactful.

Because again, there is a precedent in our own short history as a nation of Democrats forming their own government that does not recognize the statutory power of an executive branch headed up by a president they did not recognize as legitimate.

To put it more succinctly; we shouldn't fall into the trap of thinking open rebellion is impossible because it's illegal because anyone openly rebelling de facto does not recognize the lawful authority of whoever they're rebelling against.

If the left actually does this, it should be a major warning because on the scale of refusing to recognize the legitimate and lawful authority of the president it is a much bigger step to go from no shadow government to having one than it is to go from having a shadow government to open rebellion.

The first step is the biggest, but the second step is much smaller.  Be worried if they actually take the first step.",2024-11-15 22:29:03,negative,0.6242,0.6242,0.339,0.0368,r/conservative

"They're referring to the concept of a Shadow Cabinet in Westminster-style Parliamentary democracies. 

In contrast to our Presidential and congressional system, Westminster style governments can ""fall"" at the turn of a dime.  It can happen at a scheduled election (if the country has one), or more likely, when the majority party loses the confidence of the legislature and they call snap elections/ lose a vote of no confidence.

The prime minster and his cabinet are are chosen from the party that controls the most seats in the legislature and there is a very small transition period between governments.  Basically once the election happens power is turned over to the winner.  There isn't a lame duck window between the election and an inauguration like there is in the US - the new ruling party takes over essentially the same day.

Because of that the opposition party has a slate of people that are better named ""ministers in waiting"" - they don't have any power when their party doesn't control the legislature but they stay on top of the current issues and often receive the same briefings their counterparts in power do.

There is no analog in our constitutional system of government.

"That ""someone"" has to be the PM, and even then the King or Queen has to approve dissolution of Parliament via their Governor General (or themselves in the UK). While it is usually approved it's not guaranteed. Canada suffered its first Constitutional Crisis in 1926 when the PM wanted to run another election to gain more power after his party was involved in a massive scandal, but the Governor General said nope, everything stays the same except the guy from the other party gets to be Prime Minister now (that other guy had won the popular vote anyway).  It's quite rare for a Prime Minister's term to be shorter than the maximum 5 years. Minority Governments where the PM didn't get a true majority of the vote do fall very early sometimes, but usually they just make a supply and demand agreement with one of the other parties on their side of the aisle to support them in any votes of no-confidence, so they usually survive the full five years too. Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada has been leading a minority government for 4 years now. He has to call an election by the end of 2025 though. 

Anyway, that's not why shadow cabinets exist, they are really just ""point men"" for the House of Commons when they want to press the party in power over specific topics.

Trump is not just a politician he represents an entire political movement that spans across the globe. Conservatives and populists in Canada and around the world have been treated just as badly if not worse than in the United States. So yes many Canadians do feel a strong connection with Trump's politics and you are unintelligent and a fool if you deny that reality.

"Article:

>These moves make one thing clear: under Milei, Argentina will no longer sacrifice its industrial and agricultural sectors to appease unelected bureaucrats pushing arbitrary emissions targets. This approach mirrors that of former U.S. President Donald Trump, who famously withdrew America from the Paris Agreement to protect jobs and industry. Like Trump, Milei recognizes that global climate policies disproportionately harm working people in favor of elite agendas. His rapport with Elon Musk, who has criticized the inefficiency of large-scale energy transitions without technological breakthroughs, highlights a shared belief that progress comes from innovation, not top-down mandates. Trump, Musk, and Milei: A Pragmatic Alliance The ideological alignment between Milei, Trump, and Musk signals a growing global movement rejecting alarmist climate narratives in favor of economic realism and national sovereignty. Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement set the tone for leaders unwilling to cripple their economies for performative environmentalism. Musk’s focus on technological innovation over bureaucratic restrictions reinforces the idea that real solutions require freedom, not globalist interference. Milei’s rejection of COP29 adds momentum to this movement. Developing nations like Argentina cannot afford to undermine their economies by chasing unattainable carbon goals dictated by wealthier countries.

>For Milei, the choice is clear: Argentina will prioritize the prosperity of its people over appeasing global elites. A Turning Point for the World Argentina’s withdrawal from COP29 is more than a national decision—it’s a global wake-up call. It exposes the hypocrisy of developed nations outsourcing their emissions to poorer countries while demanding strict compliance with unachievable standards. For too long, international climate agreements have been tools for leftist control, punishing developing nations with financial burdens and unattainable mandates while wealthier nations evade responsibility. Under Milei’s leadership, Argentina is leading the charge toward a future defined by common sense and sovereignty. His bold stance challenges the very foundation of these agreements and offers a blueprint for other nations to follow. The so-called “leftist lie” of the climate crisis is unraveling as more countries recognize the cost of blind allegiance to flawed policies. This is a pivotal moment not just for Argentina but for the world. President Javier Milei’s leadership is lighting the path toward a new era of independence, innovation, and economic growth.

>By putting his people first and rejecting globalist fearmongering, Milei is proving that prosperity and freedom matter more than pandering to the climate elite.

>In summary ""Milei's administration is prioritizing national sovereignty and economic growth over global climate commitments. This includes downgrading the Ministry of Environment, slashing its budget, and redirecting resources to address Argentina's economic challenges. His stance is clear: *Argentina will not be bound by international climate policies that he believes hinder economic progress.*

>Milei's approach mirrors that of Trump, focusing on innovation and economic pragmatism rather than adhering to what he views as restrictive climate mandates. This alignment with Trump and other leaders who share similar views suggests a continued push against global climate initiatives in favor of national interests.""",2024-11-15 18:16:21,neutral,0.5634,0.2875,0.5634,0.1491,r/conservative

"For those who can;t be bothered:

***Nonwhite voters overall***. Obama carried these voters by 64 points; Harris carried them by 34 points. Democratic decline: 30 points.

***Black voters***. Obama carried black voters in 2012 by an amazing 93 points. Harris managed only a 67-point margin. Democratic decline: 26 points.

***Latino voters***. Obama carried Latinos by 39 points, Harris by just 12 points. Democratic decline: 27 points. It is interesting that the overall decline since 2012 is quite similar between blacks and Latinos; however, essentially all of the decline for Latinos was post-2016 while the black decline has been more or less continuous.

***Working-class (non-college) voters overall***. Obama was the last Democratic presidential candidate to carry the working class as a whole (3-point margin). But Harris lost them solidly by 13 points. Democratic decline: 16 points.

***White working-class voters***. The traditional trouble spot for Democrats; Obama lost them by 20 points, which goes up to 30 points in this election. Democratic decline: 10 points—which is a substantial and very consequential decline among a huge voter group. However, that decline pales in magnitude when compared to the decline among *nonwhite* working class voters.

***Nonwhite working class voters***. Obama cleaned up among nonwhite working-class voters, carrying them by 67 points in 2012. This election the margin was down to 32 points, cutting the Democratic advantage by more than half. Democratic decline: 35 points.

***Black working-class voters***. Black working-class voters gave Obama a 94-point margin in 2012, actually higher than among their college-educated counterparts. But in 2024, the Democratic margin among the black working class—64 points—was lower than among the college-educated, reversing the class polarity of the black vote. Democratic decline: 30 points.

***Latino working class voters***. These voters gave Obama a 43-point advantage, much higher than among the Latino college-educated. In 2024 this crashed to a mere 8-point advantage for Harris. Democratic decline: 35 points, two and a half times the decline among the Hispanic college-educated.

***Young voters***. Obama carried voters under 30 by 23 points; this election Harris managed only a 4-point advantage among this age group to the shock of most, particularly Democratic, observers. Democratic decline: 19 points.

Of course, this is comparing an age group that had a different generational composition in the two elections. But this should provide little comfort to Democrats. The 18-29 year old age group in this election was composed almost entirely of Gen Z voters, supposedly the leading edge of a [generational shift](https://www.liberalpatriot.com/p/the-progressive-youth-chimera?utm_source=publication-search) that would make the voting pool ever more Democratic. In 2012, the 18-29 year olds who provided Obama’s 23 point margin were all members of the Millennial generation. In 2024, those voters are now entirely contained in the 30-44 year old age group, where Harris eked out only a 3-point advantage. So much for the generational theory of political dominance.

***Young black voters***. Black voters under 30 gave Obama a 92-point margin in 2012. Harris carried them by only 50 points. Democratic decline: 42 points(!) The decline was almost as large among black voters 30-44.

***Young Latino voters***. In 2012, Obama dominated Hispanic voters under 30 by 54 points. Harris’s margin among these voters was just 17 points. Democratic decline: 37 points.

***Male black voters***. While black female voters have also shifted right over time, the shift among black men has been far larger—almost three times the size. In 2012, Obama carried black men by 91 points; Harris’ margin crashed to 49 points in 2024. Democratic decline: 42 points.

***Male Latino voters***. Latino men have also shifted harder right than their female counterparts. Obama enjoyed a 32-point advantage among Hispanic men in 2012. In this election, Harris was essentially tied among these voters, carrying them by only single percentage point. Democratic decline: 31 points.",2024-11-15 15:15:42,neutral,0.5092,0.4074,0.5092,0.0834,r/conservative

"Dry yeast or active yeast doesn't need this particular process. However, if you do want to improve the crust and the overall bake, place an oven-proof tray or oven-proof pan with water and place at the bottom of the oven. Some people will even add lava rocks to the tray before pouring some water, claiming there's better steam dispersal.

I find I get a nice crust and a very fluffy crumb when I do this. If you want to skip this step and achieve an extra fluffy crumb, you can add a tablespoon of avocado oil or refined coconut oil into the dough when you're mixing it, after you've mixed in the yeast. If you really want to go overboard with a fluffiness, you can use the tangzhong method but I recommend this only for breads that are already on the fluffy, plushy side, like Japanese milk bread, challah bread, brioche and the like.

To give your bread 2 days extra longevity, you can autolyse the dough, which consists of mixing the water and flour an hour to several hours before mixing in the yeast, salt and any other inclusions. 

As an aside, but I'm sure you already know, when not in use, leave instant or active yeast in the freezer. It should last a year and a half there but always test a bit of it before adding to the dough.",2024-11-15 21:28:39,neutral,0.4904,0.0369,0.4904,0.4728,r/conservative

"Tl;dr The only truly important pieces I mention are the fact that, firstly, fetal homicide laws grant the right to one sex to make legal determinations not accessible to anybody else at any other time and, secondly, the United States Givernment grants no right to fathers to determine whether they’ll be a father or not, while women get to decide that freely for both people, and it’s courts have repeatedly ruled that being even an underage male gictim of rape by a woman does not release the child that was raped from child support and, in all cases I know of, the rapist mother got full custody too. Damn any concessions to them until that changes pronto.

Edit 2: I mean for Christ’s sake, male child rape victims have f\*\*k all for parental rights but we are supposed to have bleeding hearts for women only? I’m sorry I cannot do that

I’m about as “the primary power should lay with the states” as it gets as my ideal is returning the federal unitary part of our government to a state more in line with the  articles of confederation and I also believe in states rights, nullification at least to some degree, and voluntary union. Put another way, I think the outcome of the Civil War did egregiously wrong things with dire consequences for one of the best possible reasons, but that doesn’t change my view that outside slavery being abolished like it should have been the moment we gained our independence, a lot of the other consequences that arose from the war were extremely negative and directly led to a lot of the problems we face today with an openly corrupt federal government that has gone so far in exceeding its mandate I struggle to understand why my forebears allowed this to happen.  It should have been checked and severely curtailed by whatever means necessary for wt least 60-70 years, and honestly maybe even 100 or more. But now those of us alive today are stuck with it because of what I can only see as complacency and/or cowardice.

I get this is a losing issue but it should have never been made legal in the first place aside from clearly spelled out instances of necessity for maternal health that are clear enough that there isn’t any delay or concern some POS prosecutor goes after a mother or a doctor for carrying out the procedure in such instances.

But we cannot have fetal homicide laws, even in states like California where penal code 187 which defines murder as “Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, with malice aforethought” which is but one state in the majority that has laws on the books regarding fetal homicide. A human fetus is the only life form on this planet that is selectively defined as alive but “murderable” in legal terms if the woman carrying it wants it that way, or alive but not “murderable” if the woman carrying it wants it that way. In no other instance, and with no other species, does an individual get to willy nilly decide not only whether a being is alive or not, but whether or not the killing of that being results in a lucrative career choice for another person, or the permanent taking of the freedom of another person.

So in this topic, a single human being gets to both decide whether one person involved in this potential triangle gets to live or die, and simultaneously gets to actually decide whether the person that does the deed faces wealth or prison. In no other aspect of law does an individual get to determine whether someone faces prosecution or not. In no other case within the law is an individual not empowered by the constitution and the state allowed to make such a determination. The one place we do allow that determination is for the convenience of a group of humans.

Whether one believes in God or not, and whether it is an affront to God or not if they do believe, it is still an affront to law, to logic, to the equality of all, and to life itself. Then God forbid you ask from compromise from the other end oh noooo, only one segment of the population has to sacrifice and accept what to them is murder, something that nobody has the right to do except in self defense (not murder) unless you are a government and even that can be debatable. Okay well what about granting an equivalent right to men? Obviously there is no way for the male to carry the child but abortion allows the female half of the population to determine whether a child is born or killed and therefore whether the male is a father or not, which is yet another way that in this case only an individual gets to decide whether somebody faces lifelong legal repercussions or not. Since the United States government has repeatedly ruled that a female raping even an underage male is not grounds for the woman to lose custody nor release the underage rape victim from child support obligations, how am I supposed to view a government that goes wildly out of its way to protect one sex, while legitimately facilitating the rape of men, even underage boys, by granting child raping women custody AND child support FROM THEIR RAPE VICTIM?

I realize compromise is inevitable and the ship in my beliefs has sailed long ago. But I’ll be damned if I support any kind of concession or compromise when the United States Government has the view that a male child raped by a woman is on the hook for child support and not even having custody of the baby born of his rape. There needs to be major major major changes to the rights of men in this domain before women that want abortion should get any kind of concession and compromise.

"Hey I'd be interested in your perspective. Trump obviously was vocal about it and claimed the 2020 election was fraudulent. Since he won this election, he hasn't said it was fraudulent.

So what does that mean? Did Biden, in his 4 years, implement sweeping election reform to tighten election security? Did people stop voting fraudulently this election for some reason? What was the reason that Trump has discussed as to why these elections weren't fraudulent? I've tried to look online but I think my algorithm is more tailored to other stuff, so I haven't been able to find anything.

Also Trump sent out a few tweets on election Day about massive fraud and cops in some areas, which a few people asked him to verify but I never caught any verification. I also noticed he stopped tweeting about it when he was ahead.

It will also take years to establish any new large manufacturers that can handle/match the quantity of what we currently import.

"Answer: They would be exempt (if treating US fairly, non-broad based tariff, on the principles of merit), If tariffs are exempted, it could indeed facilitate trade by reducing costs for businesses and consumers. However, if not exempted under a CSP or PTA, it's worth noting that ""Despite not being exempt from tariffs, the trade volumes between the U.S. and both South Korea and Japan remain substantial, each exceeding $150 billion USD."" Treating Argentina similarly to the 50+ energy export countries the U.S. trades with could foster stronger trade relations. High levels of FDI both ways can boost economic growth and create jobs.

For instance, the U.S. and Germany have upwards of $1 trillion USD in FDI, along with cooperation in areas like patent sharing and a university sharing system. Drawing parallels to the US-Germany relationship, which involves significant FDI and cooperation in areas like patents and university exchanges, suggests a model for US-Argentina relations. Additionally, the U.S. has a higher volume of exports to Argentina compared to imports, further highlighting the potential for a balanced and mutually beneficial trade relationship.

Further, ""The U.S. prioritizes anti-corruption and strong logistics. Therefore, Argentina's efforts to create a stable trade environment must be successful, include anti-corruption measures, and ensure efficient trade flows to attract U.S. investment.""

Overall, it shows they can be on a path to be treated either like a South Korea or Japan, or Vietnam's CSP etc. and/or like a Germany in the region, upwards 1 trillion FDI (Foreign direct investment) etc. ""This plan shows how Argentina can improve its economic and trade relations with the U.S. by focusing on fairness, stability, and mutual benefits.""

Let me further on your tariffs question, ""The U.S. has made tariff exemptions for countries like South Korea and Japan, *considering factors such as a stable trade environment, strong anti-corruption measures, and efficient logistics***.** While inflation and debt are important, trade decisions primarily focus on stability, logistics, and anti-corruption efforts.""

Nextly, finally, ""The U.S. works closely with other countries in specific industries to boost trade and economic growth. For example, they partner with Japan and South Korea in tech and car manufacturing, and with Turkey in shipbuilding. These partnerships help each country use their unique strengths to work together and grow their economies. A similar approach could potentially be chosen for Argentina."" So, *specifically assigned company industry partnership is another potential path*, if wanted to follow - otherwise US does with other nations. The US does have needs say in shipbuilding and planebuilding for example. ""there is a demand for modernizing and expanding the shipbuilding industry to meet both military and commercial needs"". Maritime collaboration (US-Flagged and Argentina-Flagged sustainable large barge commercial) to lower supply chain costs is promising, including Arctic icebreaker production (since they are near the Antarctic region). Many options and flexible partnership choices exist, offering numerous opportunities - these are areas where US also has need and Congress consistently discusses, nearly on a daily (even just yesterday).

"Answer:

* There is no direct quote from Donald Trump explaining the exceptions made for countries like Korea, Vietnam, and Japan, because the actual policies implemented by the US Trade Representative (USTR) and Commerce Department may not have aligned with his initial statements.
* This is due to the significant influence these agencies have over trade policy, allowing them to shape final decisions and implement exceptions that may not match the President's initial intentions.
* ""What happens isn't what he says unless he totally appoints USTR Commerce Dept from ground up etc. and/or ITA and more""
* If Trump were to appoint officials to the USTR and Commerce Department from the ground up, he would have more control over the agencies and their policies, allowing him to shape trade decisions that align with his initial intentions.
* The collaborative nature of government means that various stakeholders and officials can influence final policy decisions.

It goes like this GSP (Generalized System of Preferences), then TIFA (Trade and Investment Framework Agreement), then PTA (Preferred Trade Agreement), then Strategic Partnership (ESP-Enhanced) or CSP (Comprehensive Strategic) and FTA (Free Trade Agreement) etc. Thus Donald with his team has potential power to upgrade GSP's to TIFA, or TIFA's to PTA etc. and or PTAs to Strategic Partnerships, and then FTA etc. And in that upgrading power, he has power to chisel them or threaten broad-based tariff etc. or chisel ""in this process, he could use the power to ""chisel"" these agreements or leverage broad-based tariffs to influence negotiations and achieve desired outcomes.""

Trump's Trade Policy Powers

* Upgraded existing trade frameworks and negotiated new agreements
* Examples:
   * USMCA (replaced NAFTA)
   * KORUS (renegotiated to address trade imbalances and improve market access)
   * U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement (reduced tariffs and increased market access for US goods) - Enhanced Strategic Partnership (similar to Comprehensive Strategic Partnership CSP)
* Influenced and reshaped trade agreements, including GSP and PTAs (e.g. with Greece and Serbia)
* Potential for future individual trade deals with specific EU countries (e.g. Austria and Poland) ""U.S. has primarily engaged with EU as a whole, there's definitely potential for the U.S. to focus on individual trade deals with specific countries, say ie: including Austria and Poland, or say Italy etc. in the future.""

U.S. does not have a specific trade agreement with South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA), Trump had power to influence and upgrade existing frameworks and negotiate new agreements with individual SAFTA member countries. anti-corruption efforts may have gotten in way (say Pakistan etc.)

How Trade Policy Works

* The US Trade Representative (USTR) and Commerce Department have a big say in shaping trade policy, often influencing final decisions that might not align with the President's initial ideas.
* Trade policies are shaped by multiple stakeholders, including:
   * The President
   * USTR
   * Commerce Department
   * EXIM (Export-Import Bank of US, Dnld renewed its importance), ITA Other agencies
* Each of these stakeholders has different perspectives and priorities, which can lead to exceptions to the President's trade policies.
* Trump had the power to create ""enhanced strategic partnerships"" to upgrade and strengthen relationships with other countries.

Donald had (has) the power to influence and reshape trade agreements, including those involving Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs), like with Greece and Serbia for example. ""Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs), Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) is one example involving Serbia"" Basically, has ""ability to ""chisel"" and re-negotiate trade frameworks"" but his messaging suggests broad-based tariffs, this could be a media tactic, hard to read.

The US is one of the top 3-5 members of the WTO, giving it significant leverage and influence in shaping the organization's policies and rules. As a top member, the US has used its leverage to advance its trade interests and promote its economic goals.

"* **Current Situation:** An estimated 60% to 70% of ICE officers are currently stuck behind desks.

Thousands of ICE officials currently relegated to desk work will be reassigned to field duties as part of President-elect Donald Trump and Tom Homan's plan to enforce stricter immigration laws and target sanctuary cities. While there is excitement among officers about returning to field operations, concerns remain about resource limitations and the need to fill dozens of vacant positions to effectively carry out mass deportations. Homan intends to prioritize arrests of illegal immigrants who pose threats to national security and public safety and plans to reintroduce worksite raids halted by the Biden-Harris administration.

Details:

* **Plan:** These officers will be reassigned to field duties to increase enforcement activities.

**2. Excitement Among Officers:**

* **Sentiment:** Rank-and-file members are eager to return to field operations, with some expressing excitement about ""catching criminals"".

**3. Sanctuary Cities on Notice:**

* **Warning:** Homan has warned sanctuary cities to cooperate with federal officials or face increased enforcement efforts.
* **Manpower:** Enforcing tougher immigration laws will require significant manpower, and Homan plans to flood sanctuary cities with agents if necessary.

**4. ICE Workforce and Resources:**

* **Workforce:** ICE has a total workforce of about 21,000, including non-law enforcement personnel.
* **Resource Concerns:** Some officials are worried about resource limitations, even with the reassignments.

**The focus will be on arresting illegal immigrants who pose threats to national security and public safety.**",2024-11-15 03:51:50,neutral,0.633,0.2323,0.633,0.1347,r/conservative

"[John Yoo](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/john-yoo) takes on the conventional belief that Congress must authorize all foreign military engagements undertaken by a president. “The United States has used force abroad more than 100 times, but it has declared war in only five cases: the War of 1812, the Mexican-American and Spanish-American Wars, and World Wars I and II,” Yoo writes. He argues the executive branch needs “flexibility” to respond to rapidly emerging security threats, something Congress inevitably slows down to an unacceptable degree.

As Yoo writes, ""Presidents do not have complete freedom to take the nation to war. Congress has ample powers to control presidential policy. Under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, only Congress can raise the military, which gives it the power to block, delay, or modify war plans. Before 1945, for example, the United States had such a small peacetime military that presidents who started a war would have to go hat in hand to Congress to build an army and navy to fight it. Since World War II, it has been Congress that has authorized and funded our large standing military, one primarily designed to conduct offensive, not defensive, operations (as we learned all too tragically on 9/11) and to swiftly project power worldwide. If Congress wanted to discourage presidential initiative in war, it could build a smaller, less offensive-minded military.""

Absent that, Yoo argues, ""The Constitution creates a presidency that can respond forcefully to prevent serious threats to our national security.""",2024-11-15 01:33:54,neutral,0.5234,0.4237,0.5234,0.0529,r/conservative

"On *The Libertarian* podcast, Senior Fellow [Richard A. Epstein](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/richard-epstein) and Policy Fellow [Tom Church](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/tom-church) discuss the names advanced by president-elect Trump so far as he shapes a cabinet. They dwell on Trump’s unconventional choices for secretary of defense, director of national intelligence, and attorney general. They also discuss the possibility Trump will use recess appointments to fill these roles.

The duo also consider the elevation of South Dakota governor Kristi Noem, who is being put up to head the Department of Homeland Security.

>\>> Richard A. Epstein: That's an awfully big job, and it's a job that I think should not go to somebody who's been a governor. Whether or not she killed the dog, I don't care about that. It's a huge branch of operation. She comes from a very small state. She doesn't have any foreign policy experience or dealing with this.

>So essentially, I think she's an able woman, but I am very skeptical that she is gonna be able to run this thing in the method in which it goes. And the reason it's extremely important is that whole operation has been a complete mess under Biden. And I think you have a better shot of getting it under control by having somebody who's been engaged in that particular area and can work better with it.

>So this is not an appointment that I would have made. There may be another place for her in the administration. It's not something which I'm gonna gnash my teeth about. But if I were asked whether or not I'd vote to confirm it, I'd have to think long and hard before I would say yes.

"I don't think he is anti-vaccines. He publicly says he takes vaccines. I think he's against the Covid vaccine specifically due to a whole host of reasons. There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of the covid vaccine, and I think that is a healthy take. One is the efficacy/effectiveness. Science ""experts"" initially said you WILL NOT get covid if you get the vaccine. Over the months, that effectiveness rating declined tremendously. Dr. Fauci also said this, and he denied adverse effects. Well months later after thousands of people were getting heart problems and myocarditis, Dr. Fauci said that yes, it can have that effect. This was one lie among many, many others. Now you could say ""well science evolves!"" but it usually doesn't evolve in a matter of weeks/months like this. They just lied and are trying to cover.

"You are misunderstanding the lawsuit. Here is a breakdown:

1. The Lawsuit Focused on Reporting Requirements, Not Vaccine Safety Testing. Key Quote:
""WHEREAS, on August 25, 2017, Informed Consent Action Network ('ICAN') submitted a Freedom of Information Act request... that sought the following records: Any and all reports transmitted to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate by the Secretary of HHS pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §300aa-27(c).""
Explanation: The lawsuit sought records related to biennial reports required by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. It did not challenge or allege the absence of safety data or testing of vaccines.

2. The Absence of Reports Does Not Imply Absence of Safety Testing.
Key Quote:
""The Department’s searches for records did not locate any records responsive to your request.""
Explanation: The absence of these reports does not mean vaccines lack rigorous safety testing. These reports were administrative requirements intended to summarize actions taken to ensure vaccine safety, not to replace or document actual safety testing.
3. Voluntary Dismissal and No Judgment on Vaccine Safety
Key Quote:
""That the above-captioned action is voluntarily dismissed, with prejudice... each side to bear its own costs, attorney fees, and expenses.""
Explanation: The case was voluntarily dismissed without a ruling on the underlying claims. There was no judicial finding against vaccine safety or testing.

My main point: The lawsuit does not argue that vaccines are unsafe or untested; it simply highlights that HHS did not comply with the statutory requirement to report their vaccine safety actions to Congress.

"I am only going to do this with you once, against my better judgment, because I know how this game is played having worked as an agrochemicals researcher for many years. Here’s how it works. You do a selective reading of the scientific literature, dismiss any evidence that contradicts your hypothesis, require impossibly definitive proof in spite of overwhelming evidence, and—RFK Jr.’s specialty—employ rhetorical techniques which appeal to fairness and the right to dissent. Any attempts I make to counter your argument are answered with more of the same until you exhaust my time, and you will take any questions left unanswered as further proof of your hypothesis. These techniques have been employed for decades by conspiracy theorists to great effect, and are quite convincing to an uneducated audience. I am not your target audience.

Given the above, I am only going to address the study you linked by Mawson et al., which is actually somewhat well known as an example of bad science. Here are just a few of the major issues:

- Poor study design, relying solely on self-reporting via online questionnaire.

- Extreme potential for selection bias. The study was advertised via homeschooling organization email lists, and the advertisements disclosed its objective: “to evaluate the effects of vaccination by comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated children in terms of a number of major health outcomes…” Clearly, parents who believe that their child may be harmed by vaccines are more likely to respond to such an advertisement and report adverse events.

- A first iteration of this study was provisionally accepted in *Frontiers in Public Health* and quickly retracted after major methodological flaws were discovered.

- The present iteration of this study was published in the *Journal of Translational Science*, removed amidst heavy criticism, and reappeared without explanation. This is an obscure, predatory journal with low standards for peer review.

The study design is so fatally flawed as to make the results uninterpretable, and the authors evidently lack even the most basic understanding of sampling bias. There are other issues with this study such as the source of funding, authors’ affiliations and so on which I will leave to the interested reader.",2024-11-15 04:06:25,negative,0.6881,0.6881,0.284,0.0279,r/conservative

"Those are good points, I just picked that study at random because I wanted to find something not behind a paywall. My bad I'm not doing any due diligence beyond checking that it was peer reviewed, I caught the sampling bias in failing to account for consistency in the age of subjects and mothers but not the collection of subjects. I have read good studieswith small sample size that suggest there is a link but you are correct in that many more large and well conducted studies show absolutely no links when controlling for external factors.

As I said, I don't really believe vaccines are responsible for chronic disease, I just do not believe in their safety beyond a reasonable doubt. My general concern is twofold - there's a lack of separation and antagonism between regulators (broadly) and regulated agencies, which leads to safety faults such as poor engineering on Boeing aircraft and a failure to identify OxyContin as highly addictive; separately, the significant increase in autoimmune and learning disorders amongst children to a degree such that it is challenging to explain simply by better testing starting in the 1990s.

"1. I assume FRA is a typo for FDA? I am not trying to argue that they did not fail to comply with their reporting requirements. They clearly did not have the documentation there were supposed to submit. HOWEVER, the failure to submit reports does not imply the absence of safety testing or rigorous evaluation of vaccines.
While failing to file these reports is absolutely a procedural violation, it does not constitute evidence that safety protocols or studies were bypassed. Agencies occasionally fail in documentation and reporting, but these administrative lapses are separate from the scientific protocols involved in vaccine development. This is what I meant by this lawsuit is being spun to promote a false narrative that the safety testing was never done. 

2. Vaccines are tested in rigorous trials, though not always through double-blind placebo-controlled studies, for ethical reasons. Some vaccine trials do involve placebo groups, but ethical considerations can limit the use of true placebos when effective vaccines already exist. This is not unique to vaccines; it's a standard approach in clinical research when withholding effective treatment would cause harm. 

For example, when testing new antibiotics for severe infections, patients with life-threatening infections cannot ethically be given a placebo when effective antibiotics exist. Trials compare new antibiotics to standard treatments rather than a placebo. Denying antibiotics in such cases would lead to preventable deaths or severe complications.

This applies to your example of cancer drugs. The analogy to cancer drugs is flawed, as when testing new cancer treatments, placebo groups can be used because patients still receive the standard of care, not no care. For vaccines, withholding a known protective vaccine to test a new one raises significant ethical concerns. In situations like these, the process is extremely nuanced and requires ethics, efficacy, and existing treatments to be carefully balanced. 

3. Regarding vaccine approval processes, the FDA requires extensive testing for all vaccines, including phase I, II, and III trials that assess safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy in large populations. Claims that vaccines are less rigorously tested than other drugs are misleading just because of the lack of requirement for double-blind studies, due to the above ethical considerations I stated above and the examples I listed.

4. I recognize that vaccines are subject to an exceptional level of scrutiny due to their wide use in healthy populations like children. The justification for expedited vaccine approval processes where applicable  is due to decades of data showing vaccines are one of the safest and most effective public health measures. Unlike cancer medications, vaccines protect healthy individuals from becoming ill in the first place, which carries different ethical and logistical considerations.

"> A conservative government would make it good by shrinking it, and putting guardrails up to prevent new red tape and expansions.

This is just not true. I'm not sure what was so hard for you to understand about what I said. I even spelled it out for you with a specific example that disproves what you just wrote! And yet you still didn't get it???

Tolerance of intolerance leads to the disappearance of tolerance. You cannot just blindly shrink government in every context that's not always the right answer to advance conservative ideals and net freedom, it can very often do the exact opposite in terms of the net effect.

In this specific case of health, we have an industry that is totally corrupted by big government. Simply taking away regulations to let that already corrupted industry do what it wants is completely flawed and will just result in more authoritarianism and undermine the conservative cause at the end of the day. It will result in worse outcomes.

Here is another example for you. Consider scenario 1), an ideal environment for conservatives. We the people run our own schools and teach our population to be good productive members of society. Consider scenario 2), where our authoritarian government controls the schools and has indoctrinated the population to raise criminals and destructive members of society who can't think for themselves. In scenario 1) you can remove the barriers and open up society, and it will thrive. In scenario 2) if you open it up you will get more destruction and make things worse because the people cannot handle freedom, the system at its roots is tainted so it doesn't work. You can't have some elements of your system be conservative when they rely on other elements also being conservative that are not and are tainted by big government already.

Why is this so hard for you to understand?

I’m talking about the *things you can’t see*. Our food has to be regulated because when it isn’t, there is a 100% chance those who are providing it will take advantage of every cost-cutting measure they can get their hands on. It’s a guarantee.

"Joe Biden reportedly asked Donald Trump to work with him to secure a hostage deal in the Middle East when they met at the White House.

The two men spoke on Wednesday when Mr Trump returned to the White House for the first time in four years, as Mr Biden prepares to hand over the reins of power to the Republican.

Later that day, the US president revealed he had asked Mr Trump to work with him to secure the return of US citizens held captive by Hamas in Gaza before he leaves office on Jan 20, in a meeting with families of American hostages, Axios reported.

The two men agreed the issue was urgent when they spoke for almost two hours in private, according to the website.

Mr Biden has just over two months to secure the release of the four Americans who are still believed to be alive, in what would be a significant legacy achievement for a politician who has long prided himself on his foreign policy credentials.

Axios reported the president told the families they have every right to be angry at him for not yet bringing their loved ones home, sources said.

The relatives are then said to have asked for meetings with recently-announced members of Mr Trump’s incoming administration.

It comes after Mr Biden appeared to lose patience with an Israeli journalist earlier in the week, who asked him if he could ensure the return of hostages by the end of his term.

“Do you think you can keep from getting hit in the head by a camera behind you?” he told the reporter, during a meeting in the Oval Office with Isaac Herzog, the Israeli president.

Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, said on Tuesday the White House had said he had “sent a signal” to Mr Trump’s team that it is prepared to work with them on the return of the hostages.

“We’re prepared to work with the incoming team in common cause on a bipartisan basis to do everything in our collective American power to secure the release of the hostages, both living and deceased,” he said.

Mr Trump said he had discussed the Middle East when he spoke about his closed-door meeting with the president to the New York Post.

“I wanted – I asked for his views and he gave them to me,” the president-elect said.

“Also, we talked very much about the Middle East, likewise. I wanted to know his views on where we are and what he thinks. And he gave them to me, he was very gracious.”

Some had cast doubt on Mr Trump’s chances of securing a hostage deal in the Middle East after naming a series of foreign policy hawks to his cabinet.

In a video from December last year, circulated as Marco Rubio’s nomination as secretary of state was announced, the Florida senator said he opposed a ceasefire in Gaza and wanted Israel to “destroy every element of Hamas they can get their hands on”.

Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor appointed ambassador to Israel, asserted there was “no such thing as a Palestinian” during his 2008 presidential campaign.

Mr Trump also told the Post that his presidential transition team and the Biden White House enjoyed a “very, very good relationship”.

The meeting between the two men on Wednesday was their first direct interaction since their presidential debate in June, in which Mr Trump suggested his opponent was mentally deficient.

At the same event, Mr Biden said the Republican had “the morals of an alley cat” and “had sex with a porn star”, referring to his alleged affair with the adult film star Stormy Daniels.

"Article: As if the election last week weren’t traumatic enough for Democrats, they are now being triggered anew by President-elect Donald Trump’s outside-the-box choices for posts in his incoming administration, including the likes of Elon Musk, Tulsi Gabbard, Vivek Ramaswamy, and perhaps especially Pete Hegseth.

Not everyone hates Trump’s new Defense Secretary, but the Left sure does, and the reason is, they fear him. They fear his commitment to the everyday American soldier and to Trump’s dreaded America First agenda. They don’t fear that he will bungle the job because of a lack of qualifications; they fear he will shake up the Deep State status quo and undo all their work to subvert the military.

That’s why the Left fears the idea of Pete Hegseth as SecDef. He is a warrior and a leader – not a soft D.C. bureaucrat – and an existential threat to a woke military, and that is why he is the right man for the job.

Brief summary: ""President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and Army combat veteran, for Secretary of Defense. Hegseth's nomination has sparked controversy due to his lack of senior military or national security experience, despite his impressive academic and military credentials. Critics argue that his background as a media personality and junior officer may not be sufficient for the role, while supporters believe he will bring a fresh perspective and focus on efficiency and reducing bureaucracy in the Defense Department.""",2024-11-14 16:47:28,negative,0.5302,0.5302,0.396,0.0738,r/conservative

"Donald Trump has joked about running for a third term as president even though it would flout the rules of the US constitution.

Before meeting with president Joe Biden on Wednesday, Mr Trump spoke to Congressional Republicans at the Hyatt Regency in Washington DC.

“I suspect I won’t be running again unless you say ‘He’s so good, we have to figure it out’,” he said, prompting laughter from some supporters.

Mr Trump told members of the House of Representatives that he had just run his last campaign unless they “do something”.

The 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution limits presidents to two terms.

Afterwards, several Republican lawmakers suggested Mr Trump was not being serious.

Rep Tim Burchett said: “That was a joke. It was clearly a joke.”

The New York Times reported that representative Dan Goldman of New York, a Democrat, has plans to introduce a resolution on Thursday, affirming that the 22nd Amendment will bar Mr Trump from a third term.

He called on legislators from both parties to “stand by the oath we all took to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and confirm the Congress’ commitment to this principle”.

The resolution would make clear that the 22nd Amendment “applies to two terms in the aggregate”, even if they are non-consecutive, such as Mr Trump’s. Only one previous president, Grover Cleveland, has served two non-consecutive terms, beginning in 1884 and 1892.

However, it is thought unlikely that Goldman’s resolution will make it to a vote in the Republican-dominated House.

# Democrats almost powerless to counter GOP agenda

Meanwhile, Republicans have now won enough seats to control the US House, securing the party’s hold on the government alongside the president-elect.

A House Republican [victory in Arizona,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/10/donald-trump-arizona-win-swing-state-clean-sweep/) alongside a win in slow-counting California on Wednesday, gave the GOP the 218 House victories that make up the majority. Republicans earlier gained control of the Senate from Democrats.

With hard-fought yet thin majorities, Republican leaders are envisioning a mandate to upend the federal government and swiftly implement Mr Trump’s vision for the country.

The [incoming president](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/11/13/trump-biden-meeting-white-house/) has promised to carry out the country’s largest-ever deportation operation, extend tax breaks, punish his political enemies, seize control of the federal government’s most powerful tools and reshape the US economy.

The GOP election victories ensure that Congress will be onboard for that agenda, and Democrats will be almost powerless to check it.

When Mr Trump was elected president in 2016, Republicans also swept Congress, but he still encountered Republican leaders resistant to his policy ideas, as well as a Supreme Court with a liberal majority.

But when he returns to the White House, Mr Trump will be working with a Republican party that has been [completely transformed](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/12/team-trump-whos-in-and-whos-out/) by his “Make America Great Again” movement and a Supreme Court dominated by conservative justices, including three that he appointed.

But I definitely think there should’ve been Truman or another President brought in after FDR’s two terms to finish out the war. It shouldn’t have been a “well….we’re at war so this is different, I’m gonna go ahead and run again just because it’s for the best” excuse.

He definitely could’ve stayed on in the cabinet of the next admin and continued to advise or even serve as Secretary of Defense so he still would’ve been able to oversee the war, be frontline with Churchill and Stalin, and work with the next President. But for some reason they decided that no, he should be in charge for four terms and as a result an almost scary precedent was set:

You can run for unlimited terms and basically become “king” of the republic where everyone will just fall lockstep behind you or risk becoming social pariahs because they didn’t vote for you.

"Nah I'm more on Pat Bucannon's side it probably would have been better for the whole world if the West didn't declare war on Germany.

They literally used the chaos of the war itself to cover up their atrocities against the Jews and very few even knew the holocaust was happening until years into the war.  


2) In 1939, war between Nazi Germany and Communist Soviet Union was basically inevitable. If Europe had held off declaring war after the German invasion of Poland and tried diplacy instead, they could have simply let Germany and the Soviet Union destroy each other without dragging the entire western world into the conflict.


3) Also bear in mind that even though WW2 cost over 7 million lives...the Allied victory also unleashed 50 years of Soviet Communism on the world which cumulatively cost more than 100 million lives...so I don't know you tell me what's a worse outcome in a utilitarian world. ",2024-11-14 18:49:00,negative,0.8192,0.8192,0.1644,0.0164,r/conservative

In contrast, all the left-leaning news channels present themselves as actual news, they aren't remotely entertaining and instead spend the whole time trying to fearmonger and scare viewers into trusting in them.

Gaetz made a poor choice in political allies.  A piece of shit Tax Collector for a Florida county got into deep trouble for sex trafficking and more.  This piece of shit:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Greenberg_(politician)

For a minute this Joel Greenberg asshole seemed to be a potential up and comer, he shook things up and actually had a run of good decisions.  Then he went batshit crazy and started doing shit like running a bitcoin mining operation using the County’s electricity.  He spent $380,000 for body armor, weapons, and ammunition, as well as $15,000 for office sprinklers that could be aimed at people outside his office.  Now this isn’t the South Side of Chicago, they’re in a pretty quiet and chill county.  

He and Gaetz were sorta political friends of a sort, more like “allies”.  That’s all.  

So this Greenberg was caught and found guilty as F.  He’s serving an 11 yr sentence.  In the process he was to “turn evidence” against Matt Gaetz, or that’s the line we were fed, clearly there was a deal being offered if Greenberg could shorten his sentence, that’s how a deal works.

There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that he ""knowingly"" lied and did not actually believe what he said at the time. In fact, if you watched his show you would know that he hardly took a concrete stance on it it was more like someone who didn't know what to believe and was exploring different theories. His mind changed at different points. Originally he didn't cover the hoax argument, his base wanted him to after it had gotten popular online they were upset he didn't cover it so he did a segment on it one day and had someone on to explain it. That's what they sued him over.

"I don’t like this. Sounds an awful lot like what Michelle Obama was trying to do, banning certain foods from schools. My oldest kid eats healthy (younger kids aren’t having school lunch yet), no reason he can’t have pizza day to look forward to. It’s his favorite lunch day at school, but he loves his fruits and veggies too because we treated them like a delicious snack when he was little and didn’t force him to eat them. 

Frankly, I think removing most junk foods from the eligibility list for government assistance would probably help a lot. Just my observations but I rarely see carts full of fruits and veggies and healthy meats when someone wipes a government assistance card, it’s almost always microwave meals and shitty ground beef and chips and soda and snacks and shit like that.

I could be wrong, but I feel like well-off people aren’t the obese ones, it’s the poor people who can’t afford health foods and/or don’t have time to cook meals because they’re working too much, and buy prepackaged garbage. Understand that I’m not disparaging poor people - I know how hard it is to eat healthy on a budget. I don’t have that problem anymore, but I understand it fully. $8 for a sack of grapes, or $5 for a bag of Pizza Rolls? Which one is going to make me feel more full? 

As far as fast food, spend $30 on groceries and spend an hour preparing a meal, or spend $30 on McDonald’s and eat right away? We have to figure out a way to lower costs at the grocery store so that cooking at home is a preferable option to McDonald’s… maybe somebody can kick off a trend of restaurants that cook regular home meals not coated in fattening grease or butter, and sell them for reasonable prices? 

We should cast a wider qualification net for food assistance programs but only for fruits, veggies and other healthy foods. Fruit is fucking expensive, middle class families that can get by on their own but still have tight budgets aren’t as likely to buy expensive healthy foods. Maybe they don’t qualify for full assistance but could benefit from prices on healthy foods being cut down a bit so they’re more likely to buy them.",2024-11-14 14:00:39,negative,0.5659,0.5659,0.3328,0.1013,r/conservative

"This is a microcosm of a much larger issue. Here we have one Muslim CIA official whose loyalty was *not* to the USA, but rather to the Islamic ummah (nation). Does this in any way reflect on the loyalty of millions of Muslim immigrants and their descendants living in the West?

One need not confine the argument to a single anecdotal case; various Muslims living in the West have explicitly demonstrated their disloyalty to their host countries by perpetrating hundreds of acts of terrorism resulting in thousands of lives lost since the year 2000. Furthermore, this issue is not confined to terrorism; tens and possibly hundreds of thousands of Muslims in the West have demonstrated openly in support of terrorist groups like Hamas (just recall the massive demonstrations in London over the past year and the demonstrations in so many universities throughout the USA).

Are there Muslims in the West who are loyal supporters of our democratic way of life? Undoubtedly. Thousands upon thousands. But, as pointed out, there are many thousands of others who openly reject our values. How can we distinguish among them, particularly as they first enter our countries via immigration and refugee resettlement with no real political/ideological track record? We obviously can't. Even if we could, we've made very little effort screening extremists up until now. Sure, we have terror watch-lists, but what about the literally millions of Muslims around the world who are NOT terrorists, but who are opponents of a free, secular society?

We better think long and hard before we continue with our current reckless, mindless immigration policies that welcome hundreds of thousands of Muslims every year into the Western world.

U.S. forces were more empowered as oversight diminished. Otherwise, the Trump administration essentially carried out the Obama strategy. The main exceptions were when Trump twice ordered U.S. troops out of Syria in 2018 and 2019, which led to a lot of initial confusion but not a full withdrawal. As of mid-2022, approximately 900 U.S. troops remained in northeastern Syria and at the al Tanf garrison in southeast Syria near the border with Iraq.

> In order to lay a due foundation for that separate and distinct exercise of the different powers of government, which to a certain extent is admitted on all hands to be essential to the preservation of liberty, it is evident that each department should have a will of its own; and consequently should be so constituted that the members of each should have as little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of the others.

> But the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others. The provision for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.

Rick Scott has not expressed a personal motive to resist encroachment of the powers in the Executive branch.

">  If he made fun of any city or state in the US, nobody would care.

case in point, when the singer of greenday called las vegas a shithole a few months ago.

in that case he was **actually** talking about the city (rather than the comedian who was making fun of a literal garbage problem), and those who were outraged about the puerto rico comment were lining up to say ""is he wrong?"" ""well it **is** a shithole"" etc. about vegas.",2024-11-13 17:39:32,negative,0.6638,0.6638,0.2989,0.0373,r/conservative

And the sentencing is nowhere near enough as well. I hope the pieces of inhuman scum who were involved in this heinous crime ring had their sentencing for each individual charge ran consecutive. These sacks of shit do not deserve to see the light of day as free people again.
